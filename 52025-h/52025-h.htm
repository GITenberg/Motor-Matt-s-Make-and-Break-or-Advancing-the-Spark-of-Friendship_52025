<p class="chaptitle">THE SKELETON IN THE CLOSET.</p>


<p>"Where's the old man, Prebbles?"</p>

<p>"Don't ask me, Jim. I haven't a notion."</p>

<p>"Well, there's a letter for him."</p>

<p>The postman dropped a letter on the desk in front of
the little old man on the high stool, and the door slammed.
Prebbles picked up the letter and blinked at it. For a
while he sat staring like a person in a dream, then a gasp
escaped his lips, and he slipped from the stool and carried
the letter closer to the window.</p>

<p>It was almost sunset, and a neighboring building shut
off the light, but there, close to the dusty window pane,
the light was good enough. The letter dropped from
Prebbles' shaking hand, and he fell back against the wall.</p>

<p>"It's from <i>him</i>," the old man mumbled; "it's&mdash;it's&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The words died on his lips, and a choking gurgle arose
in his throat. Trembling like a man with the palsy,
Prebbles pulled himself together and staggered to the
water cooler. He drew himself a glass, and the tumbler
rattled against his teeth as he drank.</p>

<p>"This won't do," he said to himself, drawing a hand
across his forehead in a dazed and bewildered way. "I've
got to brace up, that's what I have. But what's Newt
writing to <i>him</i> for? I&mdash;I can't understand that."</p>

<p>Prebbles went back and picked up the letter. He was
still greatly shaken, although he was getting firmer hold
of himself by swift degrees.</p>

<p>It was a very ordinary appearing letter to have aroused
such an extraordinary state of mind in the old man. The
address, in a peculiar backhand, was to "Mr. Amos Murgatroyd,
Loan Broker, Jamestown, North Dakota."</p>

<p>Prebbles was Murgatroyd's clerk, and the only clerk in
the loan office. For several weeks Murgatroyd had not
been in Jamestown, and the work of the office&mdash;what
little there was&mdash;fell to Prebbles.</p>

<p>During those weeks of absence, the broker had been
doing unlawful things. Prebbles, knowing his employer
well, expected nothing better of him; but just what
Murgatroyd had been doing, the old clerk did not know.</p>

<p>Strange men, who might be detectives in disguise,
were watching the office night and day. Prebbles had
been keen enough to discover that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the peculiar handwriting of the letter that had
had such a powerful effect upon the old clerk. Not one
man in a thousand, perhaps in ten thousand, used a pen
as the writer of that letter to the broker had used it.
Prebbles felt sure that he could not be mistaken&mdash;that
there was not the least possibility of a mistake. He knew
who the writer of the letter was, and for weeks the old
man's dream by day and night was that he could discover
the whereabouts of the man.</p>

<p>The envelope was postmarked at Steele, N. D. The
writer might be there, or he might not be there. After
setting hand to the letter, it was more than possible he
had mailed the letter at Steele and then gone to some
other place.</p>

<p>There was one way to make sure&mdash;and only one: In
order to find out positively where the writer of the letter
was, Prebbles would have to open it and read it. Although
a clerk in the office, his position did not give him
the right to open his employer's personal mail; in fact,
Murgatroyd had expressly forbidden this.</p>

<p>The letters received during Murgatroyd's absence&mdash;and
they were but few&mdash;had been placed in the office safe.
A week before, the collected letters had mysteriously vanished
during the night, and in their place was left this
scribbled line:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Dropped in and got my mail. Say nothing to any one
about my having been here.</p>

<p class="sig">
A. M."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>That was all, absolutely all, Prebbles had learned of
his employer since he had left Jamestown several weeks
before. Only two or three letters had collected in the
safe since the others had been taken, and now this one
from Steele must be added to them, unless&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Prebbles caught up a pair of scissors. Before he could
snip off the end of the envelope, he paused. To deliberately
open a letter addressed to some one else is a crime
which, if brought to the attention of the postal authorities,
is heavily punished. Prebbles was not afraid of the
punishment, for he believed that Murgatroyd himself
was a fugitive; still, it was well to be wary.</p>

<p>Laying down the scissors, he ran the end of a pen-holder
under the flap. But again he paused, realizing,
with a tremor, that he belonged to the army, the Salvation
Army. As a soldier in the ranks, had he the right
to take this advantage of his employer? On the streets,
Prebbles, because of his earnestness in the army work,
he was known as "Old Hallelujah." Poor business, this,
for Old Hallelujah to rifle his employer's mail!</p>

<p>With a groan, Prebbles pushed the letter aside and
dropped his face in his hands. While he was thus
humped over his desk, a picture of distress and misery,
the door opened and a boy came in with a telegram. The
message was for Prebbles, and he signed the receipt.
As soon as the boy had left, he tore the message open.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Forward mail at once to George Hobbes, Bismarck.</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Hobbes.</span>"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>This was from Murgatroyd, and it was not the first
time he had used the name of "George Hobbes."</p>

<p>Was Prebbles to send that letter on without first seeing
what was inside it? Duty to his employer and duty to
himself warred in his soul.</p>

<p>That last letter received for Murgatroyd might have
been taken to the police. They could secure authority
from Washington to open it. But, if the letter came
from the person Prebbles suspected, he did not want the
police to see it.</p>

<p>The six o'clock whistle blew, but Prebbles paid no attention.
He was fighting with his Salvation Army principles,
and the stake was the contents of that letter to
Murgatroyd.</p>

<p>At seven o'clock, the haggard old man, the battle still
going on in his breast, pushed the letter into his pocket
and left the office, locking the door behind him. He did
not go to the cheap eating house where he usually took
his meals&mdash;there was no supper for him that night&mdash;but
he proceeded directly to the "barracks," got into his
dingy blue cap and coat, and took his cymbals. By eight,
a dozen of the "faithful" were in the street, their torches
flaring smokily, and the bass drum, the snare drum, the
cymbals, and the tambourine whanging and clashing and
rattling a quickstep.</p>

<p>Back and forth they marched, then rounded up on a
corner and sang one of their army songs.</p>

<p>Old Hallelujah was particularly earnest, that night. His
voice was loudest in the singing, and his exhorting was
done with a fine fervor. His thin, crooked body straightened,
and his eyes gleamed, and he struck the cymbals
with unusual vigor.</p>

<p>"Ole Halleluyer is gittin' young ag'in," ran the comment
of more than one bystander.</p>

<p>"If he's so pious," observed some one, "it's a wonder
he don't break away from that ole thief, Murgatroyd."</p>

<p>It <i>was</i> a wonder, and no mistake. But the wonder
was soon to cease.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock Prebbles and the rest were back in the
barracks; and at ten-thirty Prebbles was in his five-by-ten
little hall bedroom, calmly steaming open the letter to
Murgatroyd. He had finished the fight, and had nerved
himself for his first false step. But was it a false step?
He had come to the conclusion that the end justified the
means.</p>

<p>The letter, carefully written, jumped immediately into
the business the writer of it had in mind.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I must have more money or I shall tell all I know
about you and the accident to Traquair and his aëroplane.
I can't live on promises, and I'm not going to
make a fugitive out of myself any longer just to shield
you. You're a fugitive yourself, now, but I reckon you
can dig up enough money for both of us. I have
dropped down the line of the Northern Pacific to mail
this letter; as soon as it is in the office, I'm going back
to my headquarters at the mouth of Burnt Creek, on the
Missouri, ten miles above Bismarck. You'd better meet
me there at once, as it's the safest place you can find. I
suppose you've made arrangements to have your mail
forwarded, so I'm sending this to your office. <i>Bring
plenty of money.</i></p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Newt Prebbles.</span>"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>For many a weary hour the old man paced the narrow
confines of his room, reading the letter again and again
and turning the contents over and over in his mind.</p>

<p>"The boy don't care for me, he's mad at me," muttered
Prebbles wearily, "but if I can make up with him, maybe
he can be saved. What's this about the accident to Traquair?
What does Newt know about Murgatroyd? No
matter what happens, I've got to get the boy out of Murgatroyd's
clutches. If Newt stays with him, he'll be as
bad as he is."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>It was after midnight when Prebbles dropped weakly
into a chair.</p>

<p>"Motor Matt will help me," he muttered.</p>

<p>The thought had come to him like a flash of inspiration.
And another inspiration had come to him, as well.
He made a copy of the letter, then placed the original in
its envelope, carefully resealed it, and went to the broker's
office. To take the collected letters from the safe, place
them and the one from Steele in a large envelope and address
the envelope to "Mr. George Hobbes, General Delivery,
Bismarck, N. D.," consumed only a few minutes.</p>

<p>"Motor Matt will know how to do the rest of it,"
thought the old clerk. "He's a clever lad, and he helps
people. He helped Mrs. Traquair and he'll help Prebbles.
I'm done with this office for good, and I'm glad
of it."</p>

<p>He looked around the room with a grim laugh.</p>

<p>"I never thought I'd be pulling the pin on myself," he
said aloud. "Maybe it's the poorhouse for mine, but I'll
be glad to starve if I can make up with Newt and save
him from that robber, Murgatroyd."</p>

<p>He turned off the light and closed and locked the office
door. An hour later he had dropped the long envelope
into a letter box and was back in his room. At seven in
the morning he had boarded the northbound train for
Minnewaukon and Devil's Lake. Motor Matt was at
Fort Totten, on the south shore of the lake, and Prebbles
would be at the fort in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The king of the motor boys was the old man's hope.
Prebbles knew Matt, and had abundant faith in his ability
to accomplish seemingly impossible things.</p>

<p>"He'll help me," murmured Prebbles, leaning back in
one corner of the seat; "he helped Mrs. Traquair, and
he'll help me."</p>

<p class="chaptitle">WHAT NEXT?</p>


<p>"An elegant day&mdash;for ducks," said Joe McGlory, turning
from the window against which a torrent of rain was
splashing. "I'd about got my nerve screwed up to the
place where I was going to take a fly with you in the
<i>Comet</i>, pard."</p>

<p>"Well," laughed Matt, "perhaps it will be a clear, still
day to-morrow, Joe."</p>

<p>"The day may be all right, but whether I have the
necessary amount of nerve is a question. It takes sand
to sit on a couple of wings and let a gasoline engine push
you through the clouds. Sufferin' jack rabbits! Why,
Ping, that little, slant-eyed chink, has got more sand
than me when it comes to slidin' around through the
firmament on a couple o' squares of canvas. I'm disgusted
with myself, and that's honest."</p>

<p>"It's as easy as falling off a log," remarked Lieutenant
Cameron, of the Signal Corps. "I've been up with Matt,
and I know. He does all the work, McGlory. You
won't have to do anything but sit tight and hang on."</p>

<p>"'Sit tight and hang on!'" echoed the cowboy.
"Sounds easy, don't it? At the same time, Cameron, you
know that if your hair ain't parted in the middle, the
overweight on one side is liable to make the <i>Comet</i> turn
turtle."</p>

<p>"Hardly as bad as that," grinned Matt.</p>

<p>The three&mdash;Lieutenant Cameron, Motor Matt, and Joe
McGlory&mdash;were in Cameron's quarters in officers' row at
the post.</p>

<p>One window of the room overlooked the parade
ground and, if the weather had not been so thick, would
have given a view of the old barracks, beyond. Another
window commanded a prospect of the lake, just now
surging high and lashing its waters against the foot of
the bluff on which the fort stood.</p>

<p>The post was practically abandoned, and no more than
a handful of soldiers were in possession. Most of these
comprised a detail of the Signal Corps sent there for the
try-out of the Traquair aëroplane with which Matt had
acquitted himself so creditably.</p>

<p>It was about three o'clock in the afternoon, and all day
long Matt and McGlory had been housed up at the post
on account of the storm.</p>

<p>Ping Pong, the Chinese boy, was watching the aëroplane,
which was in a big shelter tent not far from the
post trader's store.</p>

<p>The cowboy, grumbling over the cheerless prospect
from each window of the room, finally returned to his
rocking-chair and sat down.</p>

<p>"What next, Matt?" inquired Cameron. "You don't
remain long in any one place, and I've been wondering
when you'd leave here and where you'd go."</p>

<p>"We're liable to break out in any old place on the
map," said McGlory. "That's what I like about trailing
around with Pard Matt. You never know, from one
week to the next, whether you're going to hang up your
hat in Alaska or Panama. It's the uncertainty and the
vast possibilities that hooked me."</p>

<p>"I haven't laid any plans," remarked the king of the
motor boys. "The failure of the government to buy that
aëroplane, after Joe and I had put up a lot of money and
time building it, leaves me with the machine on my hands.
It's something of a white elephant."</p>

<p>"It needn't be a white elephant," returned Cameron.
"You can crate the <i>Comet</i> and leave it here at the post
until you find a use for it. The other aëroplane which
you and Mrs. Traquair sold the war department is
going to prove such a success that I am sure the government
will be after this one. It will take a little time.
There's a certain amount of red tape connected with the
matter, you know."</p>

<p>"I'm hoping the government will buy the machine, but
I don't feel like leaving it in storage while we're waiting
for the war department to make up its mind."</p>

<p>"Why don't you go hunting for Murgatroyd?" inquired
Cameron. "The government has offered a reward
of one thousand dollars for his capture."</p>

<p>Murgatroyd had not only tried to wreck the first Traquair
aëroplane at the time of the government trials at
Fort Totten, but he had also resorted to crime in an attempt
to secure, from Mrs. Traquair, a quarter section of
land in Wells County, which, for some mysterious reason
of his own, he was eager to get hold of. A deserter from
the army, Cant Phillips by name, had assisted Murgatroyd
in his nefarious work; and, for that, Phillips was
now on his way to Fort Leavenworth to serve out a long
sentence in a government prison, and Amos Murgatroyd
was a fugitive.</p>

<p>Matt and his friends had been drawn into these lawless
plots of the broker's, and Cameron supposed that, apart
from the reward offered for the broker's capture, the
young motorist would be eager to see him brought to
book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've lost interest in Murgatroyd," said Matt. "He's
a scoundrel, and the government is dealing with him.
What I want to do is to put the aëroplane to some profitable
use. It was damaged considerably, when Murgatroyd
brought it down with that rifle shot, and Joe and I
have had to put up about three hundred more good dollars
for repairs. Now that it's all shipshape and ready to
fly once more, I feel as though we ought to make it earn
something for us, instead of leaving it here at Fort Totten
in storage."</p>

<p>"Aëroplanes are built to sell, aren't they?" asked the
lieutenant quizzically. "How can you make any profit
off them if you don't sell them?"</p>

<p>"Well, for one thing," replied Matt, "aëro clubs, in
different parts of the world, are offering prizes for flights
in flying machines. This machine of Traquair's, as you
know, Cameron, is the best one yet invented. It can go
farther and do more than any other aëroplane on the
market."</p>

<p>"I guess that's right," agreed Cameron.</p>

<p>"However, I'm not thinking of flying for a prize. We'd
have to go to Europe in order to get busy with a project
of that sort, and I don't want to leave the United States&mdash;at
least, not for a while yet."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't go out of the country, Matt," said Cameron
earnestly. "You're under contract, you know, not to
dispose of any of the Traquair patents to foreign governments."</p>

<p>"I wasn't thinking of such a thing as that, Cameron.
What I was thinking of is this: Yesterday I received a
letter from a show&mdash;&mdash; one of these 'tented aggregations,'
as they're called in the bills&mdash;offering five hundred dollars
a week if we would travel with the outfit and give
two short flights each day from the show grounds&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>McGlory was on his feet in an instant, waving his
hand above his head and hurrahing.</p>

<p>"That hits me plump!" he cried. "I've always wanted
to do something in a show. Whoop-ya! Matt, you old
sphinx, why didn't you say something about this before?"</p>

<p>"I've been turning the proposition over in my mind,"
answered Matt. "Frankly, I don't like the idea of traveling
with a show so much as I do the prospect of earning
five hundred a week. I'll have to find out, too, whether
the manager of the show is good for the money before
I'll talk with him."</p>

<p>"Are we going to St. Paul for an interview?"</p>

<p>"No, to Fargo. The show will make that town in
about a week, and I wired the manager that we would
meet him there. The <i>Comet</i> will carry two light-weight
passengers in addition to the operator, so you and Ping,
Joe, will have to fly with me to Fargo. We can save
railroad fare by going in the aëroplane, and that's why I
want to get you accustomed to being in the air with the
machine."</p>

<p>Cameron listened to Matt with an air that showed
plainly his disapproval.</p>

<p>"You won't like the show business, Matt," he declared.</p>

<p>"I understand that," was the response, "but it's the
salary that appeals to me."</p>

<p>"Furthermore," continued Cameron, "the manager of
the show will probably dock your salary every time you
fail to pull off a flight. You know how hard it is to bank
on the weather. At least half of each week, I should say
at a guess, you will find it too windy to go up."</p>

<p>"We'll have to have an understanding with the manager
about that. It will have to be a pretty stiff wind,
though, to keep me from flying. I've got the knack of
handling the aëroplane, now, and a moderate breeze won't
bother me at all."</p>

<p>"The show's the thing!" jubilated McGlory. "Speak
to me about that, will you? The king of the motor boys
and the <i>Comet</i> will be top-liners. And <i>draw</i>? Well, I
should say! Why, they'll draw the people like a house
afire."</p>

<p>The first Traquair aëroplane&mdash;the one sold to the government
after the Fort Totten trials had been christened
the <i>June Bug</i> by McGlory; but this one, built by
Matt after the Traquair model, he had himself named the
<i>Comet</i>. This name was to perpetuate the memory of a
motorcycle which Matt had owned and had used with
telling effect in far-away Arizona.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I wish you all the luck in the world, Matt,"
said Cameron heartily, "although I tell you flat that this
show project of yours doesn't commend itself to me worth
a cent. However, you know your own business best.
You have demonstrated, beyond all doubt, that the Traquair
aëroplane can travel across country equally as well
as around a prescribed course. This makes it possible
for you to take your friends aboard and fly to Fargo, or
to New York, if you want to&mdash;providing the wind isn't
too strong and nothing goes wrong with the machinery,
but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Cameron did not finish. Just at that moment a rap fell
on the door, and he turned in his chair to ask who was
outside.</p>

<p>"O'Hara, sor," came the response from the hall.</p>

<p>"What is it, O'Hara?"</p>

<p>"There's a little old man wid me, sor, who has just
rained in from Minnewaukon. He's as damp as a fish
and about all in, sor, an' he's afther wantin' t' spake wid
Motor Matt."</p>

<p>"Bring him in, at once."</p>

<p>The door opened and Sergeant O'Hara entered the
room, half dragging and half carrying a water-soaked
individual who dropped feebly into a chair.</p>

<p>"Prebbles!" exclaimed the king of the motor boys,
starting back in amazement.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">BRINGING THE SKELETON OUT.</p>


<p>The old clerk was so wrought up over the business he
had in hand that he had given scant consideration to himself.
All his life&mdash;ever since he had been cast adrift to
make his own way in the world&mdash;he had been a clerk.
The only outdoor exercise he had ever taken consisted
in walking from his sleeping quarters to his boarding
place, and thence to the office, back to the boarding place
for lunch, then back once more for supper and to his
lodgings for sleep. During the last few months, since
joining the "army," he had had evening exercise of a
strenuous nature, but it came at a time of life when it
merely ran down the physical organism instead of building
it up.</p>

<p>It was a bedraggled and shattered Prebbles that completed
the trip by wagon from Minnewaukon to the post.
This lap of the journey was through a driving rain, the
old man being insufficiently protected by a thin horse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
blanket. His whole body was shaking, as he sat dripping
in the chair, and his teeth clattered and rattled.</p>

<p>Several times Prebbles tried to speak to Motor Matt,
but the chill splintered his words into indistinguishable
sounds.</p>

<p>O'Hara peered into the clerk's gray face, and then
turned a significant look at his superior officer.</p>

<p>"Sor," said he, "th' ould chap ain't built t' shtand a
couple av hours in th' rain."</p>

<p>"Get him something hot from the kitchen, sergeant,"
ordered Cameron. Then, when O'Hara had left, the
lieutenant turned to Matt. "Bring him into my bedroom,
Matt you and McGlory. I've some clothes he can put
on. They'll be a mile too big for him, but they'll be
dry."</p>

<p>"Don't try to talk now, Prebbles," admonished Matt,
as he and the cowboy supported him into the next room.
"You'll feel better in a little while and then you can talk
all you please."</p>

<p>O'Hara came with a pitcher of hot milk, in which the
post doctor had mixed a stimulant of some kind, and he
was left in the bedroom to help Prebbles out of his wet
clothes and into the dry ones.</p>

<p>"Who is he?" inquired Cameron, when he and the boys
were once more back in the sitting room.</p>

<p>"Murgatroyd's clerk," replied Matt. "I saw him once,
when I first reached Jamestown and called on the broker
to make inquiries about Traquair's aëroplane."</p>

<p>"Then, if he works for a scoundrel like Murgatroyd,
he must be of the same calibre. Like master, like man,
you know."</p>

<p>"That old saw don't apply to this case, Cameron," said
Matt earnestly. "Prebbles is a good deal of a man. He
belongs to the Salvation Army and tries to be square with
everybody. Why, the very first time I called on Murgatroyd,
Prebbles warned me to beware of the broker."</p>

<p>"The old boy is the clear quill," said McGlory, "you
take it from me. But what's he doing here? Sufferin'
horned toads! Say, do you think he's come to tell us
something about Murg?"</p>

<p>"By Jove," muttered Cameron, with suppressed excitement,
"I'll bet that's what brought him!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Matt. "We'll know all about it, in a
little while."</p>

<p>In less than half an hour the old clerk emerged from
the room, in a comfortable condition outside and in. The
only thing about him that was at all damp was a sheet of
folded paper which he carried in his hand.</p>

<p>"We had to swim, just about, from Minnewaukon over
here," muttered Prebbles, as he lowered himself into a
chair. "You're mighty good to an old man, Motor Matt,
you and your friends."</p>

<p>"When did you leave Jamestown?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"This morning."</p>

<p>"Then it was raining hard when you got off the train
at Minnewaukon!"</p>

<p>"Raining pitchforks!"</p>

<p>"Why didn't you wait in the town until the rain was
over?"</p>

<p>"There wasn't time," and the shake in Prebbles' high-pitched
voice told of his growing excitement. "I just
had to get here, that's all. What I've got to say, Motor
Matt," he added, with an anxious look at Cameron and
McGlory, "is&mdash;is mighty important."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we'd better go, then," said Cameron, with a
look at the cowboy.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," interposed Matt. "Has what you've
got to say anything to do with Murgatroyd?"</p>

<p>"He's a robber," barked Prebbles: "he's worse'n a
robber. Yes, Murg's mainly concerned in what I've got
to say."</p>

<p>"Then it will be well for Cameron to stay and hear it.
He represents the government, and the government is
after Murgatroyd. As for McGlory, here, he's my pard,
and I have few secrets from him."</p>

<p>"All right, then," returned Prebbles. "It ain't a pleasant
story I'm goin' to tell&mdash;leastways not for me. I've
got to dig a few old bones out of my past life, and I
know you won't think hard of me, seeing as how I belong
to the army. It's a great thing to belong," and the
old man seemed to forget what he was about to say, for
a few moments, and fell to musing.</p>

<p>The young motorist, the cowboy, and the lieutenant
waited patiently for Prebbles to pull himself together and
proceed. The old clerk's haggard face proved that he had
suffered much, and his three auditors had only kindness
and consideration for him.</p>

<p>"It's like this," went on the old man suddenly, pulling
himself together and drawing a hand over his eyes. "I
was married, a long while ago&mdash;so long it seems as
though it must have been in another world. I reckon I
was happy, then, but it didn't last long. My wife died
in two years and left me with a boy to raise. I wonder if
you know how hard it is for a man like me to bring up a
boy without a good woman to help? The job was too
much for Prebbles. I did the best I knew how, on only
thirty-five dollars a month, givin' the lad an education&mdash;or
trying to, rather, for he never took much to books and
schooling. He ran away from me when he was fifteen,
an' I didn't see him again until last spring, when he was
twenty-one.</p>

<p>"Six years had made a big difference in that boy,
friends. He had gone his way, and it wasn't a good way,
either. He was in Jimtown just a month, gamblin' and
carryin' on, and then him and me had a quarrel. They
were bitter words we passed, me accusin' him of dishonoring
his dead mother and his father, by his ways,
and him twitting me of bein' a failure in life just because
I didn't have the nerve to be dishonest and go to grafting.
I must have said things that were awful&mdash;I can't remember&mdash;but
all I do know is that Newt hit me. He knocked
me down, right in Murgatroyd's office. Murg was out,
at the time, and Newt and me was alone there together.
When I came to, Newt was gone."</p>

<p>Again was there a silence, the old clerk fingering a
scar on the side of his cheek.</p>

<p>"How like a serpent's tooth is an ungrateful son," went
on Prebbles. "And yet, Newt wasn't all to blame. I
wasn't the right sort to bring up a high-spirited boy. I
wasn't able to do my duty. He left four hundred in
gamblin' debts, when he went away. Murgatroyd showed
me the I O U's with Newt's name to 'em. That's why
I kept right on workin' for Murg, when I knew he was
a robber, and after I had joined the army. I've been
taking up those I O U's. Three of 'em's been paid,
and there's one more left; and here I've pulled the pin
on myself before takin' up the other. I don't know what
I'm going to do for a job," and a pathetic helplessness
crept into the old clerk's voice, "but," and the voice
strengthened grimly, "I started out on this thing and I'm
going to see it through. What I want, is to make up with
Newt. Lawsy, how that quarrel has worried me! I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
don't care about the way he hit me&mdash;he had the right, I
guess&mdash;but I want to make up with him an' get him
back."</p>

<p>The old man dropped his face in his hands. The other
three looked at him sympathetically, and then exchanged
significant glances.</p>

<p>"It isn't so hard, Prebbles," remarked Matt gently, "to
advance the spark of friendship, and it ought to be more
than easy in the case of you and your son."</p>

<p>Prebbles lifted his head and his forlorn face brightened.</p>

<p>"I knew you'd help me, Matt," and he put out his thin,
clawlike hand to grip Matt's; "you help everybody that
wants you to, and I knew sure you'd see me through this
business. I did what I could for you&mdash;remember that?
Mebby what I done didn't amount to such a terrible
sight, but I put you next to Murgatroyd the first time you
ever came into his office."</p>

<p>"Of course I'll do what I can to help you, Prebbles,"
said Matt reassuringly.</p>

<p>"It's make or break with me, this time," shivered
Prebbles. "I'm pretty well along to stand such a row as
I had with Newt."</p>

<p>"Where is Newt now?" inquired Matt.</p>

<p>"That's the point!" murmured Prebbles, trying to
brace up in his chair. "Somehow, he's got under the
thumb of Murgatroyd, or Murg's got under <i>his</i> thumb,
I can't just understand which."</p>

<p>Prebbles smoothed out the damp sheet of folded
paper on his knee.</p>

<p>"I belong to the army," he quavered, "and I don't feel
that what I've done's wrong. A letter came to Murgatroyd,
at the office, last night. It was addressed in Newt's
handwriting. I opened that letter and made a copy of it;
then I sent the letter on, with some others, to George
Hobbes, Bismarck. That's the name Murg uses when
he pretends he's lendin' money for some one else. He
can gouge and strip a man, while sayin' he's actin' for
Hobbes, see?"</p>

<p>Every one of the three who had listened to Prebbles
was deeply interested. The bringing in of Murgatroyd
seemed to offer a chance for capturing the rascal.</p>

<p>"Here's the letter, Motor Matt," said Prebbles. "Read
it out loud, and then you'll all understand. There's a way
to get Newt, and advance the spark of friendship, as you
call it. By doin' that, the boy can be saved from the influence
of Murgatroyd&mdash;and that's what I want."</p>

<p>Matt took the copy of the letter from the clerk's nerveless
hand and read it aloud. Just as he finished, Prebbles
slumped slowly forward out of his chair and fell in a
senseless heap on the floor.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">MARKING OUT A COURSE.</p>


<p>"Poor old codger!" exclaimed McGlory, as he and
Matt lifted the clerk and carried him to the bed in the
other room. "He's had more trouble than he could
dodge, pard."</p>

<p>"He didn't try to dodge it, Joe," answered Matt quietly,
"and that's to his credit. He's worn out. I'll bet that,
while he was scrimping in order to take up his son's I O
U's, he has hardly eaten enough to keep himself alive.
His constitution is broken down, and this trip in the rain
from Minnewaukon has topped off his endurance. It's
only a faint, that's all, but it proves the old man has got
to be looked after."</p>

<p>Matt and McGlory had revived Prebbles before Cameron
came with the doctor. The latter, after listening to
as much of the matter as the boys could tell him, felt the
old man's pulse and shook his head gravely.</p>

<p>"We'll have to keep him in bed for a day or two, I
think," he said.</p>

<p>"Don't say that!" begged Prebbles. "I got work to
do, doctor! Besides, this isn't my bed&mdash;it belongs to
Motor Matt's friend, Cameron, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Motor Matt's friend," put in the lieutenant, "is only
too glad to give you his bed, Prebbles. I can sleep on the
couch in the next room, and you can stay here until you're
well enough to leave."</p>

<p>"But I can't stay here," cried Prebbles querulously.
"Didn't you hear me say I had work to do? I've got to
help Motor Matt&mdash;all of you know why."</p>

<p>"Anyhow, Prebbles," said Matt, "nothing can be done
until morning. You stay here and keep quiet until then.
Meanwhile, Cameron, McGlory, and I will mark out a
course, and we'll tell you all about it before we begin
following it. If you're able, you can go with us. If
you're not able, you can stay here and feel sure that I'll
carry out this make-and-break affair of yours just as
though it was my own. You can trust me to advance the
spark of friendship, can't you?"</p>

<p>"There ain't any one else I'd trust but you, Motor
Matt," declared Prebbles. "But I'm going with you, in
the morning. I haven't any money&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You don't need any," interrupted Cameron. "You're
welcome to stay here as long as you please, at the government's
expense. You have brought a clue which may
lead to the capture of Murgatroyd, and the government
has offered a reward of one thousand dollars for him."</p>

<p>"If he can be captured, Prebbles," added Matt, "the
money will go to you."</p>

<p>"It'll come in handy, but&mdash;but it's Newt I want."</p>

<p>At a nod from the doctor, Matt, McGlory, and Cameron
went into the other room and closed the door.</p>

<p>"Prebbles will never be able to leave here to-morrow
morning," averred Cameron.</p>

<p>"It's up to McGlory and me," said Matt, "to do what
we can."</p>

<p>"Give me a share in the work," begged Cameron.
"Perhaps I can do something. If necessary, I'll get a
furlough."</p>

<p>Matt was thoughtful for a few moments. Stepping to
the window overlooking the parade ground, he peered
out at the weather. The rain continued to come down in
torrents, but there was a hint, overhead, that the storm
would not last out the night.</p>

<p>"We have a good clue to Murgatroyd's whereabouts,"
said Matt presently, coming back and taking a chair facing
his friends, "but there are several points to be considered.
Prebbles sent on the original of his son's letter
last night. That means that some time to-day Murgatroyd
got the letter in Bismarck. If it is raining as hard,
over on the Missouri, as it is here, it is unlikely that Murgatroyd
went up the river to Burnt Creek to-day. With
clearing weather, he'll probably go up to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Then," said Cameron, "it's our business to take a
train for Jamestown at once, connect with a west-bound
train there for Bismarck, and then take a team and drive
from Bismarck to Burnt Creek."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>"The afternoon train has left Minnewaukon," answered
Matt, who seemed to have considered every phase of the
matter, "and there is no other train south until to-morrow
morning. That train, I think, connects with one on
the main line for Bismarck, but we could hardly reach the
town before late to-morrow afternoon, and it would be
night before we could get to Burnt Creek. While we
were losing all this time, what will Murgatroyd be
doing?"</p>

<p>"Why not get an automobile from Devil's Lake City,"
suggested Cameron, "and reach Jamestown in time to
connect with an earlier train?"</p>

<p>"How will the roads be after this rain?" inquired Matt.</p>

<p>"That's so!" exclaimed Cameron, with a gloomy look
from one of the windows. "These North Dakota roads
are fine in dry weather, but they're little more than bogs
after a rain like this. We can't use the automobile, that's
sure, and Murgatroyd is likely to reach Burnt Creek before
we can possibly get there. Will he and young Prebbles
stay at Burnt Creek until we arrive? That's the
point."</p>

<p>"It's so uncertain a point," said Matt, "that we can't
take chances with it."</p>

<p>"We've <i>got</i> to take chances, pard," put in McGlory,
"unless we charter an engine for the run to Jamestown."</p>

<p>"There's another way," asserted Matt.</p>

<p>"What other way is there?" asked Cameron.</p>

<p>"Well, first off, we can send a message at once to Bismarck,
to the chief of police&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sufferin' blockheads!" grunted McGlory. "I never
thought of that."</p>

<p>"How are the police going to locate Murgatroyd?"
went on Cameron. "The scoundrel is there under an
assumed name."</p>

<p>"Why," said Matt, "tell the police, in the message, to
arrest any man who calls at the post office and asks for
mail for 'George Hobbes.'"</p>

<p>"Easy enough," muttered Cameron.</p>

<p>"No," proceeded Matt, "not so easy as you think, for it
may be that Murgatroyd has already received the letter.
But shoot the message through at once, Cameron, and
let's do all we can, and as quick as we can."</p>

<p>The message was written out and sent to the telegraph
office by O'Hara.</p>

<p>"Now," said Cameron, "assuming that that does the
trick for Murgatroyd, there is still young Prebbles to
think about. He'll wait at Burnt Creek, I take it, for
Murgatroyd, and if Murgatroyd is captured, and isn't
able to leave Bismarck, we can reach Burnt Creek in time
to find our man and advance that 'spark of friendship'&mdash;which,
to be perfectly candid, I haven't much faith in."</p>

<p>"I believe," said Matt, "that the greatest scoundrel that
ever lived has an affection for his parents, somewhere
deep down in his heart. If I'm any judge of human nature,
that cowardly blow Newt gave his father has
bothered the young fellow quite as much as it has that old
man, in there," and Matt nodded toward the door of the
bedroom. "Leaving out sentiment altogether, though,
and our ability to reach Newt on Prebbles' behalf, there's
something else in his letter that makes the biggest kind of
a hit with me."</p>

<p>"What's that?" came from both Cameron and McGlory.</p>

<p>"Well, young Prebbles is asking Murgatroyd for
money, and hinting at something he knows about the accident
to Harry Traquair. You remember that Mrs.
Traquair's husband lost his life, in Jamestown, by a fall
with his aëroplane. It is possible that young Prebbles
knows more about that accident than Murgatroyd wants
him to know."</p>

<p>"Speak to me about that!" muttered the wide-eyed
McGlory. "Matt, you old gilt-edged wonder, you're the
best guesser that ever came down the pike! Give him the
barest line on any old thing, Cameron, and this pard of
mine will give you, offhand, all the dips, angles, and formations."</p>

<p>"This is plain enough, Joe," protested Matt.</p>

<p>"I can see it now," said Cameron, "but I couldn't before.
There are big things to come out of this business,
friends! I feel it in my bones."</p>

<p>"And the biggest thing," declared Matt, with feeling,
"is making Newt Prebbles' peace with his father."</p>

<p>"Then," said Cameron, with sudden animation, "I'm
to get leave and go with you by train, to-morrow morning,
to Bismarck, on our way to Burnt Creek?"</p>

<p>Matt shook his head.</p>

<p>"That depends, Cameron," he answered, dropping a
friendly hand on the lieutenant's knee.</p>

<p>"Depends on what?"</p>

<p>"Why, on whether it's a clear, still day or a stormy
one."</p>

<p>Both Cameron and McGlory were puzzled.</p>

<p>"I can't see where that comes in," said the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"If it's a fine day, Joe and I will go to Burnt Creek
with the <i>Comet</i>."</p>

<p>McGlory jumped in his chair.</p>

<p>"That's another time I missed the high jump!" he exclaimed.
"Never once thought of the <i>Comet</i>."</p>

<p>"All roads are the same," went on Matt, "when you
travel through the air. Apart from that, we can cut
across lots, in the <i>Comet</i>, and do our forty to sixty miles
an hour between here and the Missouri and Burnt
Creek."</p>

<p>Cameron was dashed. He was eager to take part in
the work of bagging Murgatroyd, and in finding Newt
Prebbles.</p>

<p>"Suppose an accident happens to the flying machine,"
said he, "and you are dropped on the open prairie, fifty
miles from anywhere? You wouldn't be gaining much
time over the trip by train."</p>

<p>"We won't go by air ship," replied Matt, "unless we
are very sure the conditions are right. Give me the
proper conditions, and I'll guarantee no accident will
happen to the <i>Comet</i>."</p>

<p>"But McGlory is scared of his life to fly in the machine,"
went on Cameron. "Why not leave him here and
let me go with you?"</p>

<p>"Not in a thousand years!" clamored McGlory. "I'm
going to ride in the <i>Comet</i>. That's flat."</p>

<p>"Well, the machine will carry three," proceeded Cameron.
"Why not leave the Chinaman behind and take
me?"</p>

<p>"The <i>Comet</i> will carry three light weights," laughed
Matt. "You're too heavy, Cameron."</p>

<p>"That lets me out," deplored Cameron, "so far as the
<i>Comet</i> is concerned, but I'll go by train. Maybe I'll arrive
in time to be of some help."</p>

<p>"We may all have to go by train, lieutenant," returned
Matt; "we won't know about that until to-morrow morning.
For the present, though, the course is as I've
marked it out."</p>

<p>"Well, let's go and eat," said Cameron, getting up as
the notes of a bugle came to his ears. "There goes supper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
call. I'll hope for the best, but I'm for Burnt Creek,
Matt, whether I go in the <i>Comet</i> or by train."</p>

<p>Prebbles, they found, was asleep. O'Hara was brought
in to sit with him while they were at supper, and all three
left the room.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE START.</p>


<p>The following morning dawned clear, and bright, and
still. It was a day made to order, so far as aëroplane
flying was concerned.</p>

<p>Matt and his cowboy chum spent the night at the post.
Before turning in, Matt got into sou'wester, slicker, and
rubber boots and churned his way down to the aëroplane
tent to see how Ping and the machine were getting along.</p>

<p>Everything was all right, and the heavy, water-proofed
canvas was turning the rain nicely. Ping was in love
with the <i>Comet</i>, and could be counted on to guard it as
the apple of his eye.</p>

<p>"As fine a morning for your start as one could wish
for," observed Cameron, with a note of regret in his
voice, as he, and Matt, and McGlory came out of the
mess hall and started along the board walk that edged
the parade ground.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, old chap, we can't take you with us," said
Matt, "but the <i>Comet</i> is hardly a passenger craft, you
know."</p>

<p>"What will you do with Prebbles, if he's well enough
to go?"</p>

<p>"We'll let Ping come with you by train. Prebbles
doesn't weigh much more than the Chinaman."</p>

<p>"Suppose Prebbles doesn't care to risk his neck in the
machine?"</p>

<p>"I don't think he'll make any objection. However,
we'll go to your quarters and make sure of that, right
now. How did he pass the night?"</p>

<p>"Slept well, so O'Hara said. He was still sleeping
when a private relieved the sergeant. McGlory," and
here the lieutenant turned to the cowboy, "do you feel
as much like flying, this morning, as you did last night?"</p>

<p>"Not half so much, Cameron," answered McGlory,
with a tightening of his jaws, "but you couldn't keep me
out of that flyin' machine with a shotgun. If we join a
circus as air navigators, I've got to get used to flying,
and I might as well begin right now."</p>

<p>"All right," answered the disappointed lieutenant, "I'll
go by train."</p>

<p>The doctor was with Prebbles when Cameron and the
boys reached the lieutenant's quarters. What is more,
the doctor's face was graver than it had been the preceding
afternoon. The old man was throwing himself
around on the bed and muttering incoherently.</p>

<p>"Delirious," said the doctor, examining a temperature
thermometer; "temperature a hundred and three, and
he's as wild as a loon. Newt, Newt, Newt&mdash;that's the
trend of his talk. You can't understand him, now, but
he was talking plain enough when I got here."</p>

<p>"Is the sickness serious?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Pneumonia. Know what that is, don't you, Matt?
It's hard enough on a person with a good constitution,
but in a case like this, where the powers of resistance
are almost exhausted, the end is pretty nearly a foregone
conclusion. However, we're taking the trouble
right at the beginning, and there's a chance I may break
it up."</p>

<p>"Get a good nurse for him," said Matt, "and see that
he gets all the care possible. The poor old chap was a
good friend of mine, once, and I'll bear all the expense."</p>

<p>"Never mind that, Matt," spoke up Cameron. "If
Murgatroyd is caught, because of the tip he gave us, the
government will be owing Prebbles a lot of money."</p>

<p>Suddenly the old man sat up in bed, his eyes wide and
staring vacantly, his arms stretched out in front of him
and his hands beating together. His voice grew clear and
distinct, echoing through the room with weird shrillness.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"At the cross, at the cross, there I first saw the light,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the burden from my heart rolled away!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was there by faith I received my sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And now I'm happy all the day!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One verse was all. Spent with the effort, Prebbles
dropped back on the pillow and continued his whispered
muttering.</p>

<p>"It's one of those Salvation Army songs," observed the
doctor.</p>

<p>"He thought he was marching and playing the cymbals,"
said Matt, in a low tone.</p>

<p>"Too bad!" exclaimed McGlory, shaking his head.</p>

<p>"Do all you can for him, doctor," urged Matt.</p>

<p>"I will, of course," was the answer, "but you may be
able to do more for him than any one else, Matt."</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"Why, by bringing back that scalawag son of his.
That's the one thing the old man needs. If we can show
Prebbles the boy, and make him realize that he's here,
and sorry for the past, it will do a world of good."</p>

<p>"I'll bring him!" declared Matt, his voice vibrant with
feeling. "Prebbles said this business would make or
break him; and, as the work is on my shoulders now,
it's make or break for me. Come on, Joe!"</p>

<p>He turned from the room, followed by McGlory and
Cameron. Out of the post went the three, and down the
hill and past the post trader's store, the king of the motor
boys saying not a word; but, when the shelter tent was
in sight, he turned to his companions.</p>

<p>"It's mighty odd," said he, "how chances to do a little
good in the world will sometimes come a fellow's way.
Through that rascal, Murgatroyd, I was led into giving a
helping hand to Mrs. Traquair; and here, through the
same man, I've a chance to help Prebbles."</p>

<p>"And you can bet your moccasins we'll help him," declared
McGlory, "even though we lose that circus contract.
Hey, pard?"</p>

<p>"We will!" answered Matt.</p>

<p>Ping had cooked himself a mess of rice on a camp
stove near the shelter tent. He was just finishing his
rations when the boys and the lieutenant came up.</p>

<p>"We're going out in the aëroplane to-day, Ping," announced
Matt.</p>

<p>"Allee light," said the Chinaman, wiping off his chop
sticks and slipping them into his blouse.</p>

<p>"You and McGlory are going with me," went on Matt.</p>

<p>The yellow face glowed, and the slant eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>"Hoop-a-la!" exulted Ping. "By Klismus, my likee
sail in Cloud Joss!"</p>

<p>"I wish I had that heathen's nerve," muttered the cowboy.
"It's plumb scandalous the way the joy bubbles out
of him. All his life he's been glued to <i>terra firma</i>, same
as me, but, from the way he acts, you'd think he'd spent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
most of his time on the wing. But mebby he's only running
in a rhinecaboo, and will dive into his wannegan as
soon as we're ready to take a running start and climb
into the air. We'll see."</p>

<p>"Pump up the bicycle tires, Joe," said Matt. "Get
them good and hard. Ping," and Matt pointed to the
haversack of provender McGlory had brought from the
post, "stow that back of the seat on the lower wing.
We may be gone two or three days."</p>

<p>"And mebby we'll be cut off in our youth and bloom
and never come back," observed McGlory, grabbing the
air pump. "This is Matt's make and break," he grinned
grewsomely; "we make an ascent and break our bloomin'
necks. But who cares? We're helping a neighbor."</p>

<p>Ping crooned happily as he set about securing the haversack.
He'd have jumped on a streak of chain lightning,
if Matt had been going along with him to make the
streak behave.</p>

<p>The <i>Comet</i> had two gasoline tanks, and both of these
were full. The oil cups were also brimming, and there
was a reserve supply to be drawn on in case of need.</p>

<p>Matt went over the machine carefully, as he always
did before a flight, making sure that everything was
tight and shipshape, and in perfect running order.</p>

<p>Even if anything went wrong with the motor, and the
propeller ceased to drive the aëroplane ahead, there
would have been no accident. The broad wings, or
planes, would have glided down the air like twin parachutes
and landed the flyers safely.</p>

<p>Cameron, having manfully smothered his disappointment,
lent his hearty aid in getting the boys ready for
the start. The machine, at the beginning of the flight,
had to be driven forward on the bicycle wheels until the
air under the wings offered sufficient resistance to lift
the craft. A speed of thirty miles an hour was sufficient
to carry the flying machine off the ground and launch it
skyward.</p>

<p>But there was disappointment in store for the boys.
The three, seated on the lower plane, Matt at the levers,
tried again and again to send the machine fast enough
along the muddy road to give it the required impetus to
lift it. But the road was too heavy.</p>

<p>The trick of fortune caused Ping to gabble and jabber
furiously, but McGlory watched and waited with passive
willingness to accept whatever was to come.</p>

<p>"I guess you'll have to give up, Matt," said Cameron.
"The road's too soft and you can't get a start."</p>

<p>Matt looked at the prairie alongside the road. The
grass was short, and the springy turf seemed to offer
some chance for a getaway.</p>

<p>"We'll try it there," said he, pointing to the trailside.
"Give us a boost off the road, Cameron, and then start
us."</p>

<p>The lieutenant assisted the laboring bicycle wheels to
gain the roadside, and then pushed the machine straight
off across the prairie. Matt threw every ounce of power
into the wheels.</p>

<p>Usually the air ship took to wing in less than a hundred
yards, but now the distance consumed by the start
was three times that. For two hundred feet Cameron
kept up and pushed; then the <i>Comet</i> went away from
him at a steadily increasing pace. Finally the wheels
lifted.</p>

<p>Quick as thought, Matt shifted the power to the propeller.
The <i>Comet</i> dropped a little, then caught herself
just as the wheels were brushing the grass and forged
upward.</p>

<p>"Hoop-a-la!" cried Ping.</p>

<p>McGlory said nothing. His face was set, his eyes
gleaming, and he was hanging to his seat with both
hands.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A SHOT ACROSS THE BOWS.</p>


<p>The sensation of gliding through the air, entirely cut
adrift from solid ground, is as novel as it is pleasant.
The body seems suddenly to have acquired an indescribable
lightness, and the spirits become equally buoyant.
Dizziness, or vertigo, is unheard of among aëronauts.
While on the ground a man may not be able to climb a
ladder for a distance of ten feet without losing his head
and falling, the same man can look downward for thousands
of feet from a balloon with his nerves unruffled.</p>

<p>Joe McGlory, now for the first time leaping into the
air with a flying machine, was holding his breath and
hanging on desperately to keep himself from being
shaken off his seat, but, to his astonishment, his fears
were rapidly dying away within him.</p>

<p>The cowboy was a lad of pluck and daring; nevertheless,
he had viewed his projected flight in a mood akin
to panic. Although passionately fond of boats, yet the
roll of a launch in a seaway always made him sick;
in the same manner, perhaps, he was in love with flying
machines, although it had taken a lot of strenuous work
to get him to promise to go aloft.</p>

<p>The necessity, on account of wet ground, of juggling
for a start, had thrown something of a wet blanket over
McGlory's ardor. Once in the air, however, his enthusiasm
arose as his fears went down.</p>

<p>Matt sat on the left side of the broad seat, firmly
planted with his feet on the footrest and his body bent
forward, one hand on the mechanism that expanded or
contracted the great wings, and the other manipulating
the rudder that gave the craft a vertical course.</p>

<p>On Matt's quickness of judgment and lightning-like
celerity in shifting the levers, the lives of all three of
the boys depended. Every change in the centre of air
pressure&mdash;and this was shifting every second&mdash;had to be
met with an expansion or contraction of the wings in
order to make the centre of air pressure and the centre
of gravity coincide at all times.</p>

<p>Upon Matt, therefore, fell all the labor and responsibility.
He had no time to give to the scenery passing
below, and what talking he indulged in was mechanical
and of secondary importance to his work. But this is
not to say that he missed all the pleasures of flying. A
greater delight than that offered by the zest of danger
and responsibility in the air would be hard to imagine.
Every second his nerves were strung to tightest tension.</p>

<p>Ping sat between Matt and McGlory, his yellow hands
clutching the rim of the seat between his knees. He
was purring with happiness, like some overgrown cat,
while a grin of heavenly joy parted his face as his eyes
marked the muddy roads over which they were passing
without hindrance.</p>

<p>Up and up Matt forced the machine until they reached
a height of five hundred feet. Here the air was crisp
and cool, and much steadier than the currents closer to
the surface.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>"Great!" shouted the cowboy. "I haven't the least
fear that we're going to drop, and I'd just as lieve go
out on the end of one of the wings and stand on my
head."</p>

<p>"Don't do it," laughed Matt, keeping his eyes straight
ahead, while his hand trawled constantly back and forth
with the lever controlling the wing ends.</p>

<p>"Him plenty fine!" cooed Ping.</p>

<p>"Fine ain't the name for it," said McGlory. "I'm so
plumb tickled I can't sit still. And to think that I shied
and side-stepped, when I might have been having this
fun right along! Well, we can't be so wise all the time
as we are just some of the time, and that's a fact. How
far do you make it, Matt, to where we're going?"</p>

<p>"A little over a hundred miles, as the crow flies."</p>

<p>"As the <i>Comet</i> flies, you mean. How fast are we
going?"</p>

<p>"Fifty miles an hour."</p>

<p>"That clip will drop us near Burnt Creek in two hours.
Whoop-ya!"</p>

<p>The cowboy let out a yell from pure exhilaration. Not
a thought regarding possible accident ran through his
head. The engine was working as sweetly as any motor
had ever worked, the propeller was whirling at a speed
that made it look like a solid disk, and the great wings
were plunging through the air with the steady, swooping
motion of a hawk in full flight.</p>

<p>A huddle of houses rushed toward the <i>Comet</i>, far below,
and vanished behind.</p>

<p>"What was that, pard?" cried the cowboy.</p>

<p>"Minnewaukon," answered Matt.</p>

<p>At that moment the young motorist shifted the rudder
behind, which was the one giving the craft her right
and left course, and they made a half turn. As the
<i>Comet</i> came around and pointed her nose toward the
southwest, she careened, throwing the right-hand wings
sharply upward.</p>

<p>McGlory gave vent to a hair-raising yell. He was
hurled against Ping, and Ping, in turn, was thrown
against Matt.</p>

<p>"Right yourselves, pards," called Matt. "That was
nothing. When we swing around a turn we're bound to
roll a little. You can't expect more of an air ship, you
know, than you can of a boat in the water. You keep
track of the time, Ping. Joe, follow our course on the
map. You can hang on with one hand and hold the map
open with the other. We can't sail without a chart."</p>

<p>Matt had secured his open-face watch to a bracket
directly above Ping's head. The boy could see the time-piece
without shifting his position.</p>

<p>The map McGlory had in his pocket. Removing the
map from his coat with one hand, the cowboy opened it
upon his knee.</p>

<p>With a ruler, Matt had drawn a line from Minnewaukon
straight to the point where Burnt Creek emptied
into the Missouri. This line ran directly southwest, crossing
four lines of railroad, and as many towns.</p>

<p>"How are we going to know we're keeping the course,
pard?" inquired McGlory. "We ought to have a compass."</p>

<p>"A compass wouldn't have been a bad thing to bring
along," returned Matt, "but we'll be able to keep the
course, all right, by watching for the towns we're due
to pass. The first town is Flora, on the branch road
running northwest from Oberon. If I'm not mistaken,
there it is to the right of us. Hang on, both of you!
I'm going to drop down close, Joe, while you hail one
of the citizens and ask him if I've got the name of the
place right."</p>

<p>There was plenty of excitement in the little prairie
village. Men, women, and children could be seen rushing
out of their houses and gazing upward at the strange
monster in the sky. Everybody in that section had heard
of Motor Matt and his aëroplanes, so the curiosity and
surprise were tempered with a certain amount of knowledge.</p>

<p>"Hello, neighbor!" roared McGlory, as the air ship
swept downward to within fifty feet of the ground, "what
town is this?"</p>

<p>"Flora," came the reply. "Light, strangers, an' roost
in our front yard. Ma and the children would like to
get a good look at your machine, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The voice faded to rearward, and "ma and the children"
had to be disappointed.</p>

<p>Having assured himself that he was right, Matt headed
the aëroplane toward the skies, once more.</p>

<p>Settlers' shacks, and more pretentious farmhouses,
raced along under them, and in every place where there
were any human beings, intense excitement was manifested
as the <i>Comet</i> winged its way onward.</p>

<p>In less than fifteen minutes after passing Flora, they
caught sight of another railroad track and another huddle
of buildings. It was the "Soo" road, and the town
was Manfred.</p>

<p>"How long have we been in the air, Ping?" asked
Matt.</p>

<p>"Fitty-fi' minutes," replied the Chinaman.</p>

<p>"Manfred ain't many miles from Sykestown, pard,"
said Joe, "and we must be within gunshot of that place
where we had our troubles, a few days back."</p>

<p>"I'm glad we're giving the spot a wide berth," returned
Matt, with a wry face. "We've got to make better
time," he added, opening the throttle; "we're not
doing as well as I thought."</p>

<p>The <i>Comet</i> hurled herself onward at faster speed.
The air of their flight whistled and sang in the boys'
ears, and hills underneath leaped at them and then vanished
rearward with dizzying swiftness.</p>

<p>"I'd like to travel in an aëroplane all the time," remarked
McGlory. "Sufferin' skyrockets! What's the
use of hoofin' it, or ridin' in railroad cars, when you can
pick up a pair of wings and a motor and go gallywhooping
through the air?"</p>

<p>The machine was well over the coteaus, now, and the
rough country would hold, with only now and then an
occasional break, clear to the Missouri.</p>

<p>Another railroad, and a cluster of dwellings known
as "Goodrich," were passed, and the aëroplane slid along
over the corner of McLean County and into Burleigh.</p>

<p>They were drawing close to Burnt Creek, and everything
was going swimmingly. Matt, notwithstanding the
severe strain upon him, was not in the least tired. In
a little less than two hours after leaving Fort Totten they
crossed their last railroad&mdash;a branch running northward
from Bismarck. The town, near where they winged over
the steel rails, was down on the map as "Arnold."</p>

<p>"Speak to me about this!" cried McGlory. "There's a
creek under us, Matt, and I'll bet it's the one we're looking
for."</p>

<p>"We're finding something else we were not looking
for," answered the king of the motor boys grimly.</p>

<p>"What's that?" queried McGlory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>"Look straight ahead at the top of the next hill."</p>

<p>McGlory turned his eyes in the direction indicated. A
number of rough-looking horsemen, evidently cowboys,
were scattered over the hill. They were armed with
rifles, and were spurring back and forth in an apparent
desire to get directly in front of the <i>Comet</i>.</p>

<p>"Why, pard," shouted McGlory, "they're punchers,
same as me. Punchers are a friendly lot, and that outfit
wouldn't no more think of cutting up rough with us
than&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The words were taken out of the cowboy's mouth by
the sharp crack of a rifle. One of the horsemen had
fired, his bullet singing through the air in front of the
<i>Comet</i>.</p>

<p>"That's across our bows," said Matt, "and it's an
invitation to come down."</p>

<p>The "invitation" was seconded by a yell the import
of which there was no mistaking.</p>

<p>"Hit the airth, you, up thar, or we'll bring ye down
wrong-side up!"</p>

<p>"Nice outfit <i>they</i> are!" grunted McGlory. "Get into
the sky a couple of miles, Matt, and&mdash;&mdash; Sufferin' terrors!
What are you about?"</p>

<p>Motor Matt had pointed the air ship earthward, and
was gliding toward the hilltop.</p>

<p>"No use, Joe," Matt answered. "They could hit us
with their bullets and wreck us before we got out of
range. They want to talk with us, and we might as
well humor them."</p>

<p>"Mighty peculiar way for a lot of cowboys to act,"
muttered McGlory.</p>

<p>"No likee," said Ping.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE MAN HUNTERS.</p>


<p>Motor Matt was not anticipating any serious trouble
with the cowboys. The worst that could possibly happen,
he believed, was a slight delay while the curiosity
of the horsemen regarding the aëroplane was satisfied.</p>

<p>Armed cattlemen are proverbially reckless. A refusal
to alight would certainly have made the <i>Comet</i> a target
for half a dozen guns, and it was a foregone conclusion
that not all the bullets would have gone wild.</p>

<p>The cowboys, of course, knew nothing about aëroplanes.
They wanted Matt to come down, no matter
whether the landing was made in a spot from which the
aëroplane could take a fresh start, or in a place where a
start would be impossible.</p>

<p>The hill on which the horsemen were posted was a
high one, and had smooth, treeless slopes on all sides.
It was, in fact, a veritable turf-covered coteau.</p>

<p>Matt was planning to alight on the very crest of the
hill. When he and his pards were ready to take wing
again, he thought they could dash down the hill slope,
and be in the air before the foot of the hill was reached.</p>

<p>The horses of the men below were frightened by the
aëroplane, and began to kick and plunge. The trained
riders, however, held them steady with one hand while
gripping rifles with the other.</p>

<p>The flying machine circled obediently in answer to her
steering apparatus, and landed on the crest of the hill
with hardly a jar. As the craft rested there, the boys
got out to stretch their cramped legs and inquire what
the cowboys wanted. The latter had spurred their restive
animals close, and were grouped in a circle about the
<i>Comet</i>.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be gosh-hanged!" muttered one, staring at
the machine with jaws agape.</p>

<p>"Me, too!" murmured another. "Gee, man, but this
here's hard ter believe."</p>

<p>"Hustlin' around through the air," put in another,
"same as I go slashin' over the range on a bronk."</p>

<p>The fourth man gave less heed to his amazement than
he did to the business immediately in hand.</p>

<p>"Ain't either one o' 'em George Hobbes?" he averred,
looking Matt, McGlory, and Ping over with some disappointment.</p>

<p>That name, falling from the cowboy's lips, caused
Matt and McGlory to exchange wondering glances.</p>

<p>"What did you stop us for?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Me an' Slim, thar, thought ye mout hev Hobbes
aboard that thing-um-bob," went on the last speaker.
"We're from the Tin Cup Ranch, us fellers are. I'm
Jed Spearman, the foreman. Whar d'ye hail from?"</p>

<p>"From Fort Totten."</p>

<p>"When d'ye leave thar?"</p>

<p>"About two hours ago."</p>

<p>"Come off! Toten's a good hunnerd an' twenty miles
from here."</p>

<p>"Well," laughed Matt, "we can travel sixty miles an
hour, when we let ourselves out, and bad roads can't stop
us. But tell us about this man, Hobbes. Who is he?"</p>

<p>"He's a tinhorn, that's what. He blowed inter the
Tin Cup bunkhouse, last night, an' cleaned us all out in
a leetle game o' one-call-two."</p>

<p>"If you're foolish enough to gamble," said Matt, "you
ought to have the nerve to take the consequences."</p>

<p>"Gad-hook it all," spoke up the man referred to as
"Slim," "I ain't puttin' up no holler when I loses fair,
but this Hobbes person is that rank with his cold decks,
his table hold outs, an' his extra aces, that I blushes ter
think o' how we was all roped in."</p>

<p>"He cheated you?"</p>

<p>"Cheat?" echoed Jed Spearman, "waal, no. From the
way we sized it up when we got tergether this mornin', it
was jest plain rob'ry. Hobbes headed this way, an' we
slid inter our saddles an' follered. But we've lost the
trail, an' was jest communin' with ourselves ter find
out what jump ter make next, when this thing"&mdash;he
waved his hand toward the aëroplane&mdash;"swung inter
sight agin' the sky. We seen you three aboard the thing,
an' got the fool notion that mebby Hebbes was one o' ye."</p>

<p>"Didn't you find out last night that you had been
cheated?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Nary. If we had, pilgrim, ye kin gamble a stack
we'd have took arter this Hobbes person right then. It
was only this mornin' when Slim diskivered the deck
o' keerds belongin' ter the feller, which same he had left
behind most unaccountable, that we sensed how bad we'd
been done. The' was an extry set o' aces with that pack,
the backs was all readers, an' the hull lay-out was that
peculiar we wasn't more'n a brace o' shakes makin' up
our minds what ter do."</p>

<p>"What sort of a looking man was this Hobbes?"</p>

<p>"Dead ringer fer a cattleman, neighbor. Blue eyes,
well set up, an' youngish."</p>

<p>Matt was surprised. He was expecting to receive
a description of Murgatroyd, but the specifications did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
not fit the broker. Murgatroyd was a large, lean man
with black, gimlet-like eyes.</p>

<p>"What's yer bizness in these parts?" demanded Jed
Spearman. "Jest takin' a leetle fly fer the fun o' the
thing?"</p>

<p>"Well," answered Matt, "not exactly."</p>

<p>"Ain't in no rush, are ye?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Now that you know the man Hobbes isn't with
us, we'll get aboard and resume our flight."</p>

<p>Matt stepped toward the aëroplane, with the intention
of taking his place at the driving levers. But Jed Spearman
stayed him with a grip of the arm.</p>

<p>"I got er notion," said Jed, "that I'd like ter take a
ride in that thing myself." The other cowboys gave a
roar of wild appreciation and approval. "Ye say ye kin
do sixty miles an hour," proceeded Jed. "I'm goin' back
ter the Tin Cup Ranch ter see if the other party that
went out arter Hobbes had any success. It's thirty miles
ter the Tin Cup, an' ye ort ter git me thar an' back inside
o' an hour&mdash;onless ye was puttin' up a summer
breeze when ye told how fast this here dufunny machine
could travel. Hey? How does it hit ye?"</p>

<p>Motor Matt was taken all aback. An hour's delay
might spell ruin so far as meeting Newt Prebbles at the
mouth of Burnt Creek was concerned.</p>

<p>"We're in too much of a hurry," said Matt, "and we
can't spare the time. I'd like to oblige you, Spearman,
but it's out of the question."</p>

<p>"No more it ain't out o' the question," growled Spearman.
"I'm pinin' ter take a ride in that thar machine,
an' ye kin help us in our hunt fer Hobbes if ye'll only
take me back ter the ranch. I reckon yore bizness ain't
any more important than what ours is."</p>

<p>"Make him take ye, Jed!" howled the other punchers.
"If he won't, we'll make kindlin' wood out er the ole
buzzard."</p>

<p>The temper of the cowboys was such that Matt was
in a quandary. While he was turning the situation over
in his mind, McGlory stepped forward and took part in
the talk.</p>

<p>"Say, you," he cried angrily, "what you putting up this
kind of a deal on us for? You can't make us toe the
mark by putting the bud to us, and if you try it, we'll
pull till the latigoes snap."</p>

<p>"Don't git sassy," said Jed, in a patronizing tone.
"We're too many fer ye, kid. Ridin' in that thing'll be
more fun fer me than a three-ring circus, say nothin' o'
the help it'll be fer us ter find out whether the other
bunch o' man hunters struck 'signs' er not. Step back,
an' sing small. Here, Slim, you take charge o' my hoss."</p>

<p>The foreman passed his bridle reins to Slim, dismounted,
and laid his gun on the ground.</p>

<p>"We'll have to wait here till ye git back, won't we?"
asked Slim.</p>

<p>"Sure," replied Jed. "We've lost the trail, an' thar
ain't no manner o' use ter keep on ontil we find out
somethin'."</p>

<p>"Then I'm goin' ter git down," said Slim. "We kin
bunch up the critters an' smoke a little."</p>

<p>McGlory's temper was rapidly growing. The cool
way in which Jed Spearman was planning to appropriate
the <i>Comet</i> was more than McGlory could stand.</p>

<p>"You're a lot of tinhorns!" he cried. "This lad here,"
he waved his hand toward the king of the motor boys,
"is Motor Matt, and he's making this flight on government
business, mainly. You keep hands off, or you'll
get into trouble."</p>

<p>"That's me!" whooped Spearman. "Trouble! I live
on <i>that</i>. Get ready that flyin' machine, kase I'm hungry
ter do my sixty miles an hour on the way back ter headquarters."</p>

<p>An idea suddenly popped into McGlory's head.</p>

<p>"This way, Matt," said he, stepping off to one side
and beckoning Matt to follow.</p>

<p>The cowboys were a little suspicious, but their curiosity
prompted them to inspect the <i>Comet</i> and leave
Matt and McGlory to their own devices.</p>

<p>"What do you think, pard?" asked McGlory, when he
and Matt were by themselves.</p>

<p>"I think it won't do to have any delay," replied Matt,
"but I don't just see how we're going to avoid it. If
it wasn't for those rifles&mdash;&mdash;" He cast a look at the
cowboys and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I've got a notion we can fool the punchers," said
McGlory, "but Ping and I will have to be left behind, if
we do it. You'll be going it alone, from here on. Think
you can manage it?"</p>

<p>"I'll try anything," answered Matt. "All I want is
to get away. Who this gambler the cowboys call George
Hobbes is, I haven't the least idea. Their description
of the fellow doesn't tally with the description of Murgatroyd,
and the whole affair is beginning to have a queer
look. I don't think there's any time to be lost."</p>

<p>"No more there isn't," replied McGlory. "Ping and
I can wander on to the mouth of Burnt Creek on foot as
soon as we can shake the punchers, and you can look for
us there. What I'm plannin' is this."</p>

<p>Thereupon McGlory hastily sketched his swiftly
formed plan. It had rather a venturesome look, to Matt,
and might, or might not, win out. There was nothing
to do, however, but to try it.</p>

<p>"What you shorthorns gassin' about?" yelled Jed
Spearman. "I'm all ready ter fly, an' time's skurse."</p>

<p>Matt and McGlory, having finished their brief talk,
walked back to the cowboys.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">FOOLING THE COWBOYS.</p>


<p>"If you're bound to make Motor Matt take you to
the ranch, Spearman," said McGlory, "that means that
the chink and me'll have to wait here till you get back."</p>

<p>"Which is what I was expectin'," answered Spearman.
"I don't want ter feel cramped in that thar machine."</p>

<p>"The rest of you will have to give the machine a start
down the hill," went on McGlory innocently. "When
the craft gets a start, and is in the air, you'll have to
watch your chance, Spearman, and jump aboard."</p>

<p>"Jump on when she's goin' sixty miles an hour?"
howled Spearman. "Say, what d'ye think my scalp's
wuth?"</p>

<p>"It won't be going sixty miles an hour," parried McGlory.</p>

<p>Matt had already taken his seat in the <i>Comet</i>.</p>

<p>"Why kain't I git in thar with him," asked Spearman,
"an' travel with the machine right from the start?"</p>

<p>"Sufferin' centipedes!" exclaimed McGlory, in well-feigned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
disgust. "Say, I reckon you don't savvy a whole
lot about flyin' machines. She's got to have a runnin'
start, as light as possible; then, when she begins to
skyhoot, you climb aboard. I guess you don't <i>want</i> to
take a trip aloft."</p>

<p>"Guess again," cried Spearman. "I kin jump some,
if it comes ter that, only"&mdash;and here he turned to Matt,
who was quietly waiting&mdash;"fly low an' slow."</p>

<p>"All of you have got to help," proceeded Matt's cowboy
pard briskly. "Lay your guns away, somewhere, so
you can give both hands to your work."</p>

<p>None of the cowboys had six-shooters, but all were
armed with rifles. This was rather odd, but, nevertheless,
a fact. When they started out after George Hobbes,
the Tin Cup men had been counting on target practice
at long range.</p>

<p>The horses had already been bunched with their heads
together. Four of the cowboys, who were still holding
their rifles, stepped hilariously over to where Slim and
Spearman had deposited their guns, and dropped their
weapons.</p>

<p>McGlory gave Ping a significant look. The young
Chinaman stared blankly for a moment, and then a complacent
grin settled over his yellow face. He was as
sharp as a steel trap when it came to understanding
guileful things. Ping knew what was expected of him,
and he was ready.</p>

<p>The <i>Comet</i> was headed down the western slope of the
hill. Four of the cowboys placed themselves at the lower
wings, two on each side, ready to run with the machine
when they received the word. Spearman, in his shirt
sleeves, was tying one end of a riata to the timber which
passengers in the aëroplane used as a footrest.</p>

<p>"What are you doing that for?" demanded Matt.</p>

<p>Spearman straightened up with a wink.</p>

<p>"Waal, it's fer two things, pilgrim," he answered
jocosely. "Fust off, by hangin' ter the rope, Slim an'
me kin pull while the rest o' the boys push. Then,
ag'in, if ye've got any little trick up yer sleeve, I'll
have a line on yer ole sky sailer an' ye kain't leave me
behind, not noways."</p>

<p>That rope troubled Matt, but he could voice no reasonable
objection to it. Already McGlory had played on
the credulity of the punchers to the limit, and it was
not safe to go much farther.</p>

<p>"I'm goin' ter have yer job, Jed," rallied one of the
cowboys, "if ye fall outen the machine an' bust yer neck."</p>

<p>"Don't ye take my job till I'm planted, Hen, that's all,"
grinned the foreman. "I been wantin' a new sensation
fer quite a spell, an' I guess here's the place whar I connect
with it."</p>

<p>If the plans of Matt and his friends worked out successfully,
Jed Spearman was to "connect with a sensation"
vastly different from what he was expecting. McGlory
was chuckling to himself over the prospect.</p>

<p>The cowboys, in their uproarious mood, did not seem
to notice that neither McGlory nor Ping were helping to
give the aëroplane a running start down the hill.</p>

<p>"Ye'll be a reg'lar human skyrocket, Jed," remarked
Slim, "if ye travel at the rate o' sixty miles an hour."</p>

<p>"I'll be goin' some, an' that's shore," answered the
foreman. "Wonder what folks'll invent next? Say,
thar! If ye're ready, let's start."</p>

<p>Matt started the motor. This evidence of power
rather awed the cowboys, and their grins faded as they
watched and listened.</p>

<p>"Now," instructed Matt, "the minute I turn the power
into the bicycle wheels, you fellows begin to run the
machine downhill."</p>

<p>"Let 'er go!" came the whooping chorus.</p>

<p>Jed Spearman and Slim, tailed on to a forty-foot
riata, were some twenty feet ahead of the aëroplane.</p>

<p>"Now!" cried Matt.</p>

<p>The bicycle wheels began to take the push, and the
<i>Comet</i> started down the slope, the two cowboys ahead
pulling, and the four at the wings pushing.</p>

<p>Naturally, the descent aided the motor. There had
not been as much rain, in that part of the State, as there
had been in the Devil's Lake country, and the turf was
fairly dry and afforded tolerably good wheeling.</p>

<p>The cowboys roared with delight as they ran awkwardly
in their tight, high-heeled boots. What happened
was only natural, in the circumstances, although quite
unexpected to the ignorant cattlemen.</p>

<p>In less than fifty feet the aëroplane was going too fast
for the runners. The four at the wings had to let go;
and the two at the rope, finding themselves in imminent
danger of being run over, dropped the rope and leaped
to one side.</p>

<p>All six of the cowboys watched while the <i>Comet</i>,
catching the air under her outspread pinions, mounted
gracefully&mdash;and then continued to mount, the riata trailing
beneath.</p>

<p>"He ain't comin' back fer ye, Jed!" howled Slim.</p>

<p>"Here, you!" bellowed the foreman. "Whar ye goin'?
What kinder way is that ter treat a feller? Come back,
or I'll send a bullet arter ye!"</p>

<p>Matt paid no attention. He was following, to the very
letter, the plan McGlory had formed, and was rushing
at speed in the direction of the Missouri and the mouth
of Burnt Creek.</p>

<p>"Git yer guns!" cried the wrathful Spearman. "Shoot
him up!"</p>

<p>It is doubtful whether the cowboys would have been
able to retrace their way up the hill and secure their
guns before Matt had got out of range. But they had
not a chance to put their purpose to the test, for the contingency
had been guarded against.</p>

<p>When the cowboys reached the top of the hill, Ping
was at the foot of it on the eastern side, traveling as
fast as his legs could carry him; and clasped in his arms
were the six rifles!</p>

<p>"Blazes ter blazes an' all hands round!" fumed the
enraged Jed. "The chink's runnin' off with the guns
so'st we kain't shoot. Hosses, boys! Capter the little
heathen!"</p>

<p>And here, again, were the cowboys doomed to disappointment.
Well beyond the foot of the hill, on the
south side, was McGlory. He was riding one horse and
leading the other five bronchos.</p>

<p>"Done!" gasped Slim, pulling off his Stetson and
slamming it on the ground, "done ter a turn! Who'd
'a' thort it possible?"</p>

<p>"It was a frame-up!" raged the foreman. "The two
of 'em hatched the plan while they were talkin'. I was
a fool ter let 'em palaver like what they done, kase I
mout hev knowed they was up ter somethin'. The chink
lifted the guns on us, an' t'other feller lifted the hosses
so'st we couldn't ketch the chink; an', as for <i>him</i>," and
Jed Spearman turned and looked westward to where the
aëroplane was a mere speck in the sky, "as fer him, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
say, if that flyin' machine ever comes crowhoppin' eround
whar I am, I'll shore put it out o' bizness!"</p>

<p>"An' ye didn't fly, arter all!" bubbled Slim.</p>

<p>"You hesh," grunted Spearman, "or thar'll be fireworks."</p>

<p>"Ye're purty good at jumpin'," jeered another, "so
why don't ye jump aboard? I don't reckon she's more'n
two mile off an' a mile high."</p>

<p>"Oh," fretted the foreman, "if I <i>only</i> had a gun! Say,
let up er I'll use my hands."</p>

<p>"An' we had to push," scoffed Slim; "oh, yas, <i>indeed</i>!
We had ter git off'n our hosses, an' put down our guns,
an' push. Never reckoned nothin', did we? Never a
thing. But they knowed, them fellers did&mdash;they knowed
ev'ry minit jest what they was about. Next time I fool
with this here Motor Matt an' his flyin' machine, ye'll
know it."</p>

<p>"An' Jed had a string on her," mourned another.
"Sure he did. Why, Jed had his rope fast to her so'st
ter hang on in case Motor Matt had anythin' up his
sleeve. Well, well! I wonder&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Spearman could stand no more. With a fierce
whoop, he rushed down the hill along the path taken by
the Chinaman. Across, on an opposite uplift, Ping could
be seen. He was adding insult to injury by hopping
up and down and making derisive gestures with one
hand.</p>

<p>"We got ter overhaul the chink an' git back them
guns," shouted Slim. "Come on, boys!"</p>

<p>The remaining five started after Spearman. Ping, observing
the pursuit, hopped out of sight over the top of
the hill. Burdened as he was, he could not hope to
escape the pursuing cowboys. But he had faith in McGlory&mdash;and
McGlory did not fail him.</p>

<p>When the cowboys reached the top of the next hill,
they could look down and see McGlory and the six
horses. Ping was mounting one of the animals, and
when he and McGlory vanished around the base of another
coteau&mdash;which they were not slow in doing&mdash;they
took the rifles with them.</p>

<p>The cowboys had to pursue, and they had to do their
pursuing on foot. If a cattleman hates one thing more
than another it is walking, and the six disgruntled Tin
Cup men limped and staggered and toiled onward through
the coteaus, following the trail for at least four miles.
When they finally ran it out, they found their horses
and their guns, but McGlory and Ping were conspicuous
by their absence.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE TRAILING ROPE.</p>


<p>Motor Matt could not look behind and take note of
how events were progressing on the hill. He could
only hope that McGlory would carry out the rest of his
plan without any setbacks, and that he and Ping would
get safely away from the foiled cattlemen.</p>

<p>The ease with which the boys had played upon the ignorance
and credulity of the high-handed cowpunchers,
would have been laughable could the young motorist have
known how successfully the rest of McGlory's plot was
to be carried out. As the matter stood, Matt was worrying
too much to enjoy the situation.</p>

<p>He carried away a memento of the recent trouble in
the shape of the trailing rope. The forty-foot line hung
downward, swinging to right and left and giving frightful
pitches to the <i>Comet</i> in spite of Matt's manipulation
of the wing ends.</p>

<p>Bending down, he tried with one hand to untie the
riata and rid the machine of its weight, but the knot
had been drawn too tight by the pulling of Spearman
and Slim. As a compromise, Matt pulled the rope in and
dropped it in the seats recently occupied by McGlory and
Ping.</p>

<p>Now for the mouth of Burnt Creek, and the carrying
out of the purpose that had brought Matt into that section.
The mystery connected with the "George Hobbes"
the cowboys were looking for, and the success or failure
of McGlory and Ping in their final clash with the Tin
Cup men, the king of the motor boys put resolutely from
his mind. He was now to look for Newt Prebbles and
advance the spark of friendship in behalf of the poor
old man at Fort Totten.</p>

<p>Matt conceived that the easiest way to reach the mouth
of Burnt Creek was to hover over the stream and follow
it to its junction with the Missouri. This man&oelig;uvre
he at once put into operation.</p>

<p>The creek was as crooked as could well be imagined,
and twisted and writhed among the coteaus, carrying
with it, on either bank, a scant growth of cottonwoods.
Matt cut off the corners, flying high enough to clear the
tops of the neighboring hills, and soon had the broad
stretch of the Upper Missouri in plain view ahead of him.</p>

<p>In a clump of cottonwoods, near the mouth of the
creek, was a small shack. Matt's view of the shanty was
not good, on account of the trees, and he could not
tell whether or not there was any one about the place.</p>

<p>He was just looking for a spot, on the river bank,
where he could make a comfortable landing, when he
was startled by discovering a skiff.</p>

<p>The skiff was in the river, well off the mouth of the
creek, and was heading for the western bank of the
Missouri. There was one man in the boat, and he was
using his oars frantically, watching the <i>Comet</i> as he
rowed.</p>

<p>"That may be George Hobbes," thought Matt, "and it
may be Newt Prebbles. In any event the fellow, whoever
he is, thinks I'm pursuing him. I'll drop lower and
give him a hail."</p>

<p>As the <i>Comet</i> settled downward over the surface of
the river, the man in the skiff redoubled his efforts with
the oars. He seemed to be seized with an unreasoning
panic.</p>

<p>"Hello, below there!" shouted Matt.</p>

<p>To slow the aëroplane too much would mean a drop
into the water, for a certain rate of flight was necessary
in order to keep the machine aloft.</p>

<p>As Matt called, he passed on beyond the boat, described
a turn over the middle of the river, and came
back toward the eastern bank.</p>

<p>The man made no response.</p>

<p>"Are you Newt Prebbles?" yelled Matt.</p>

<p>The other shouted something, in an angry tone, the
exact import of which the young motorist could not
catch. Taking his right hand from the oar, the man
jerked a revolver from his belt.</p>

<p>"Don't shoot!" cried Matt. "I'm a friend of yours."</p>

<p>The last word was snipped off in the incisive crack of
the weapon. The bit of lead zipped past Matt's head
and bored a hole through the upper wing of the air ship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>"Stop that!" called Matt sternly, pointing the aëroplane
higher and turning again when over the eastern bank.</p>

<p>Whatever he did, he realized that he must not expose
the motor and propeller to a stray bullet.</p>

<p>But no more shots were fired.</p>

<p>Matt wondered at this until he had faced the machine
about and was able to observe what was going on below.</p>

<p>The man in the skiff had lost an oar. In releasing
his hand to use the revolver, the oar had slipped from
the rowlock into the water.</p>

<p>A frantic effort was being made by the man to recover
the oar; and so wild and inconsidered was the attempt
that the skiff went over, throwing its occupant
into the river.</p>

<p>"Help!" came the cry, as the man, thrashing and
floundering, bobbed to the surface of the river between
the overturned boat and the oar.</p>

<p>It was evident, at a glance, that he could not swim,
or that he could swim so little the mere weight of his
clothes was enough to drag him under.</p>

<p>"Keep your nerve!" cried Matt encouragingly. "I'll
help you in a minute."</p>

<p>The <i>Comet</i> was well to the westward of the man.
Matt turned her sharply, at the same time bringing her
as close to the water as he dared. Then, with one hand
on the lever controlling the wing tips, with the other he
reached for the rope on the seat beside him.</p>

<p>Laying a course to pass directly over the man, Matt
leaned forward and flung the riata downward. The sinuous
coils straightened out as the rope descended, the
lower end swishing through the water.</p>

<p>"Catch the rope and hold fast!" cried Motor Matt,
as the aëroplane skimmed over the surface of the river.</p>

<p>There would be a jolt when the <i>Comet</i> took up the
slack in the riata, providing the man were successful in
laying hold of the line. Would the jolt disengage the
man's hands, or have any serious effect on the <i>Comet</i>?</p>

<p>By that time the aëroplane was so far beyond the man
that Matt could not see what he was doing. Holding
his breath, the king of the motor boys braced himself
and waited.</p>

<p>In perhaps a second the <i>Comet</i> reeled and shivered as
though under a blow. Quickly Matt turned full speed
into the propeller, and the machine steadied itself and
began to tug at the weight underneath and behind.</p>

<p>Then, slowly, the aëroplane mounted upward. At a
height of fifty feet, Matt could look down and see a
dripping form, swaying and gyrating at the end of the
riata.</p>

<p>"Can you hang on?" called Matt.</p>

<p>"Yes," was the response from below, "if you don't
want me to hang on too long."</p>

<p>"No more than a minute. By that time I'll have you
ashore."</p>

<p>The heavy weight, swinging under the machine like
a pendulum, made the aëroplane exceedingly difficult to
manage. In the early stages of aëroplane flying, equilibrium
had only been kept by swinging weights, and it
had remained for the Wrights to discover that bending
the wing tips upward or downward kept an aëroplane's
poise much better than any shifting weight could do;
and to Harry Traquair had fallen the honor of inventing
sliding extensions, whereby either wing area could be
increased or contracted in the space of a breadth.</p>

<p>Now that the <i>Comet</i> had both a shifting weight and
wing manipulations to keep her steady, she was not
steady at all&mdash;one balance seeming to counteract the
other. In spite of the terrific dipping and plunging,
however, Matt succeeded in getting to the shore.</p>

<p>The moment the man on the rope found himself over
solid ground, he let go his hold and dropped five or six
feet to the bank.</p>

<p>Instantly the <i>Comet</i> came fairly well under control
again, and would have been entirely so but for the weight
of the rope.</p>

<p>Matt selected a cleared spot in which to alight, shut
off the power, and glided to the earth easily and safely.</p>

<p>Stepping out of the aëroplane, he hurried to the spot
where the rescued man was lying.</p>

<p>"How are you?" asked Matt, kneeling beside him.</p>

<p>"I'm about fagged," he answered. "There's a cabin,
about a rod up the creek on this side. Go there and get
the bottle of whisky you'll find on the table. A pull at
that bottle will put some ginger into me."</p>

<p>"You don't need that kind of ginger," replied Matt.
"I'll help you to the cabin, and when we get there you
can get into some dry clothes. That will do you more
good than all the fire-water that ever came out of a still."</p>

<p>The man hoisted up on one elbow and peered at Matt
with weak curiosity.</p>

<p>"That's your brand, is it?" he asked, with as much
contempt as he was able to put into the words.</p>

<p>"Well, yes," replied Matt. "It's my brand, and you'd
be a heap better off if it was yours."</p>

<p>He had been scrutinizing the man closely. He now
saw that he was young, that he had blue eyes, and that
he was wearing cowboy clothes. His hat, of course, was
in the river.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" the young fellow asked.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you later," was the indefinite reply.</p>

<p>"How did you happen to be around here in that flying
machine?" went on the other suspiciously.</p>

<p>"You'll find that out, too, at the proper time."</p>

<p>"If you're from the Tin Cup Ranch&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm not, so make your mind easy on that. But I
know you. You're George Hobbes, and you robbed the
cowboys at the Tin Cup Ranch in a game of cards, last
night. You&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>With a fierce exclamation, the youth sat up, and his
right hand darted toward his hip.</p>

<p>"You're not going to do any shooting," said Matt.
"Your gun's in the river, and you'd have been there,
too, but for me. What sort of way is that to act toward
the man who saved you from drowning?"</p>

<p class="chaptitle">A BOLT FROM THE BLUE.</p>


<p>Small, and seemingly trifling, events sometimes pave
the way for vital undertakings. The performance on the
coteau, in which the Tin Cup men had so prominently figured,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
had left the <i>Comet</i> equipped with a forty-foot riata.
On the flight to the Missouri Matt had tried to untie the
rope and drop it from the machine. In this he had failed&mdash;a
very fortunate circumstance for the dripping young
man on the bank. But for that trailing rope, Matt would
never have been able to effect a rescue.</p>

<p>"It may be," said the young man, "that you have
only pulled me out of the river to give me into the hands
of the Tin Cup outfit."</p>

<p>"I have already told you," returned Matt, "that I have
nothing to do with the Tin Cup outfit."</p>

<p>"Why were you chasing me in that air ship, then?"</p>

<p>"I wasn't chasing you. You had a guilty conscience,
and if a man had been coming this way on an elephant
you would have thought he was after you."</p>

<p>The other was silent for a space, surveying Matt furtively
and, apparently, trying to guess his business.</p>

<p>"You knew about that work in the Tin Cup bunk
house, last night," said he tentatively.</p>

<p>"I heard of it from a party who are out looking for
George Hobbes. That is your name, is it?"</p>

<p>"That's the way I was billed during that performance
at the bunk house."</p>

<p>"What are you, by profession&mdash;a cowboy or a gambler?"</p>

<p>"Cowboy."</p>

<p>Matt glanced at the young fellow's hands. They
looked more like a gambler's hands than a cowboy's.
And yet, skillful though he must have been with the
cards, Hobbes had not the appearance of a gambler.</p>

<p>"Do you live here?" Matt went on.</p>

<p>"Yes," was the answer. "I told you, a moment ago,
where my shack was."</p>

<p>"Then you're not doing much in the cattle line if you
hang out in this deserted spot."</p>

<p>Hobbes gave a grunt and got up.</p>

<p>"What are you trying to pry into my business affairs
for?" he asked surlily. "Do you think saving my life
gives you a right to do that?"</p>

<p>"Well," fenced Matt, "that depends. You don't talk
like any cowboy I ever heard&mdash;your English is too good."</p>

<p>"There are a lot of punchers who use better English
than I do."</p>

<p>"Possibly," answered Matt. "I haven't been in the
cattle country very much. What was the amount of
money you stole from the Tin Cup outfit?"</p>

<p>A flush of color ran into Hobbes' tanned face.</p>

<p>"I didn't steal their money," he cried angrily. "I
played cards for it."</p>

<p>"You didn't play a square game. They found the
pack you used, this morning, and there were extra aces,
and the backs were printed in such a way that you could
tell what cards your opponents held."</p>

<p>"What of that?" was the scoffing response. "They
didn't find me out. They had the right to beat me at my
own game&mdash;if they could."</p>

<p>"I'm not here to preach," said Matt, "but you've got
yourself into a pretty bad mix. I'm willing to help
you out if you'll send back the money."</p>

<p>"I'll not send back a soo," was the answer, "and you've
got your nerve along to bat such a proposition up to me.
Who asked for your help? I didn't."</p>

<p>Hobbes turned away in a huff and started for the
creek, his wet clothes slapping about him as he walked.</p>

<p>"Just a minute, Hobbes," called Matt, "and I'll go with
you. I want to rope this flying machine to a couple of
trees, so that it won't be blown into the river if a wind
should happen to come up."</p>

<p>Hobbes was very wet, very tired, and very sulky, but
he could hardly refuse such a trifling request. With
the rope that had saved his life, he helped Matt secure
the <i>Comet</i>.</p>

<p>"Do you know any one, in these parts, by the name of
Newt Prebbles?" Matt inquired, while they were moving
toward the shack.</p>

<p>"You used that name while I was in the skiff," said
Hobbes, "I remember, now. What's your business with
Newt Prebbles?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell him that when I see him. It's important.
Do you know the man?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know him. He's a pal of mine and lives with
me in the shack."</p>

<p>"Is he there, now?" asked Matt eagerly.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"When will he be back?"</p>

<p>"That's hard to tell. He won't come back at all if you
don't tell me what your business is with him."</p>

<p>"Why so?"</p>

<p>"I'll warn him away. You've found out a lot about
me, but how much have you told me about yourself?
Not a thing. I haven't a notion who you are, and I'm
blamed if I like mysteries."</p>

<p>They were close to the cluster of cottonwoods and the
shack, and Matt fell silent. The house, as the king of
the motor boys could see, now that he was close to it,
was built of sod, and had a roof of grass thatched over
cottonwood poles. It was in a fairly good state of repair
and had evidently been occupied for some time.</p>

<p>The door stood open, and Hobbes stepped to one side
to let Matt enter first. It looked like a mere act of
courtesy, and may have been no more than that; but, in
view of what immediately happened, Matt would have
been entitled to suspicions.</p>

<p>Believing the shack to be empty, Matt crossed the
threshold. He was instantly seized by some one who
threw himself from behind the open door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>With a startled cry, the young motorist twisted around
in the strong arms that held him and caught a look at
the man's face.</p>

<p>It was Murgatroyd!</p>

<p>Another moment and all the fight in Matt's nature flew
to the surface. Putting forth all his strength, he kicked
and struggled until he had freed himself of the broker's
grip.</p>

<p>He was no sooner clear of Murgatroyd, however, when
Hobbes set upon him. Hobbes had not yet recovered
his strength, and Matt would have made short work of
him had not the broker come savagely to his aid. Between
them Matt was forced to the clay floor of the
house and lashed with a rope in such a manner that he
was powerless to move.</p>

<p>Murgatroyd, panting from his exertions, lifted himself
erect and gave the prisoner a vengeful kick.</p>

<p>"Wasn't expecting to find me here, eh?" he asked.
"You've led me a pretty chase, Motor Matt, but here we
are at the end of the trail, and I've got the upper hand."</p>

<p>Somehow Matt had fallen under the impression that
the police of Bismarck would take care of Murgatroyd;
hence, he had left the broker out of his calculations, and
this meeting with him in that sod shack was like lightning
out of a clear sky.</p>

<p>"You know this fellow, then?" said Hobbes.</p>

<p>"I know him too well, and that's the trouble. He's
meddled with my affairs until they're in a pretty tangle,
and I'll have all I can do to straighten them out again.
I wasn't expecting a chance like this," and a jubilant
note entered the broker's voice. "How did he happen
to come here, Newt?"</p>

<p>"That's too many for me, Murg. He was in a flying
machine. I saw him coming, and thought he was on
my track for a little game that was pulled off at the
Tin Cup Ranch, last night. In my hurry to get across
the river I lost an oar, and in my hurry to get the oar
I overturned the boat. I can't swim much, and with all
my clothes on I'd have gone to the bottom if he hadn't
snatched me ashore."</p>

<p>Motor Matt was not much surprised to hear Murgatroyd
call the supposed Hobbes "Newt." The young
motorist's mind had been working around to that view
of the young fellow's identity. He was Newt Prebbles,
and was on friendly terms with the master scoundrel,
Murgatroyd.</p>

<p>The broker seated himself in a chair, and did not seem
particularly well pleased with the news Prebbles had
just given him. Perhaps, for his peace of mind, he was
wishing that Matt had not rescued Newt, and it may be
he resented the "hold" this rescue gave Matt on Newt's
gratitude&mdash;providing Newt harbored such a sentiment,
which seemed doubtful.</p>

<p>Newt began changing his clothes. Before he began,
he took a bottle from the table and poured himself a
drink of its fiery contents.</p>

<p>"When did you get here, Murg?" he demanded, as
he got into his clothes.</p>

<p>"It must have been while you were having that trouble
on the river. I didn't see anything of the flying machine,
and I didn't hear anything of the fracas. Feeling
sure you'd be back soon, I hitched my horse among
the cottonwoods and came in here to wait. I heard you
and Motor Matt talking as you walked this way, and
I had to rub my eyes in order to make sure it was really
Motor Matt who was coming. Jove, but this is a stroke
of luck!"</p>

<p>"You'll have to tell me about that, for it's mighty dark
to me. You got my letter all right?"</p>

<p>"Naturally, or I shouldn't be here. The letter arrived
in Bismarck yesterday forenoon, and I pulled out of
the town at once. Stayed last night with a farmer, more
to make certain I wasn't followed than anything else."
Murgatroyd scowled. "This being a fugitive," he finished,
"gets on a man's nerves."</p>

<p>Newt laughed grimly.</p>

<p>"Did you bring the money?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Don't talk about that here," and the broker flashed
a significant glance at Matt.</p>

<p>"All right," agreed Newt. "Suppose we let this Motor
Matt, as you call him, go free? We don't want him
around, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Go free?" cried Murgatroyd. "I'll catch myself doing
that! I owe him something," and here a demoniacal
look crept into the broker's eyes, "and I guess, as my old
friend Siwash used to say, I'll take advantage of this
opportunity and 'saw off' with him."</p>

<p>This threat, however, did not make Matt feel at all
uncomfortable. He had in his hands the material necessary
to play off one of these men against the other. Out
of this might come a good deal of benefit to himself,
and much good for Newt Prebbles. In case he did not
succeed in this plan, there was McGlory and Ping yet
to be heard from. If they had safely escaped the Tin
Cup men, it would not be long before they gained the
mouth of Burnt Creek and played their part in events
to come.</p>

<p>Just then Matt felt like congratulating himself on having
been made a prisoner. Such a position gave him
the advantage of being impartial in the hostility he was
about to incite between his captors.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">"ADVANCING THE SPARK."</p>


<p>"I'm not going to stand around and let you be rough
with him," asserted Newt, finishing his dressing and taking
another drink from the bottle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nobody asked you to stand around," said Murgatroyd.
"When I'm ready to get rough, you can go down
to the river and stay there till I'm through."</p>

<p>"Why did you jump on him like that?"</p>

<p>Considering what he himself had done toward Matt's
capture, Newt's stand was hardly consistent.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you," and, with that, Murgatroyd went on
to relate the number of times his trail had crossed Matt's,
and the circumstances.</p>

<p>Newt's eyes widened as the recital proceeded, and
when the end was reached it found him moody and preoccupied.</p>

<p>"From all that," went on Murgatroyd, "you can see
just how much I am in Motor Matt's debt."</p>

<p>"He saved my life," said Newt doggedly, "and I'm not
going to let you be rough with him."</p>

<p>"Don't make a fool of yourself, Newt," scowled Murgatroyd.</p>

<p>"He did me a good turn," insisted the other, "and I'm
not going to let him get the worst of this."</p>

<p>"Sit me up in a chair, can't you?" asked Matt. "I
want to talk a little, and I'm not very comfortable, lying
here like this."</p>

<p>"It's nothing to me," snarled Murgatroyd, "whether
you're comfortable or not."</p>

<p>Without a word, Newt went to the prisoner and helped
him get to his feet and drop into a chair.</p>

<p>"Leave his ropes alone," called Murgatroyd sharply.</p>

<p>"I'm not touching his ropes&mdash;yet," returned Newt.
"What have you got to say?" he asked, facing Matt.</p>

<p>"How many I O U's for gambling debts did you leave
in Jamestown, Prebbles, when you left there?"</p>

<p>A lighted bomb, hurled suddenly into the shack, could
not have startled either of the two men more than did
this question.</p>

<p>It was a random shot on Matt's part. He wanted
both Newt and Murgatroyd to understand that he was
well equipped with information.</p>

<p>"I didn't leave a single gambling debt behind me," asserted
Newt, with rising indignation.</p>

<p>The broker became visibly uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"He's talking wild, Newt," said he.</p>

<p>"Then," continued Matt, "how did it happen that Murgatroyd
had several duebills, signed by you?"</p>

<p>"He didn't have any signed by me."</p>

<p>"Of course not," agreed Murgatroyd, laughing derisively,
but there were demons rising in his sharp eyes.</p>

<p>"Too bad your father didn't know that, Newt," said
Matt. "He's been slaving, and denying himself necessities
of life, to take up a lot of I O U's which, Murgatroyd
told him, had been given by you for gambling
debts."</p>

<p>Newt, his face full of rage, whirled on the broker in
a fury.</p>

<p>"Is that the truth?" he cried.</p>

<p>"Not a word of truth in it," answered the broker
coolly. "From what I've told you about Motor Matt,
Newt, you ought to understand that he's cunning. He's
working some sort of a dodge, now. Don't let him fool
you."</p>

<p>Newt was quieted somewhat but not convinced.</p>

<p>"Who told you about those duebills?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Your father."</p>

<p>"When did you see him? And how did he happen to
tell you anything like that?"</p>

<p>"Just a minute," said Matt, playing with the spark
before he advanced it fully. "There's a point about
George Hobbes that I'd like to have settled. Which of
you uses that name? Or have you a partnership interest
in it? Newt plays cards at the Tin Cup Ranch
as George Hobbes, and Murgatroyd does business in that
name and receives letters in Bismarck when they are so
addressed. Now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>With a hoarse exclamation of astonishment and anger,
Murgatroyd flung himself from the chair and started
toward Matt. Newt jumped in front of him.</p>

<p>"You'd better sit down, Murg," said Newt.</p>

<p>The two men stared at each other, the broker furious,
and the younger man defiant.</p>

<p>"He knows too much!" flared Murgatroyd.</p>

<p>"He says so much I know to be true that I'm inclined
to believe everything he tells us. We'll hear him out,
and if you try to lay your hands on him you'll settle with
me."</p>

<p>The spark was working splendidly. It would not be
long, now, before it set off an explosion.</p>

<p>"You wrote a letter to Murgatroyd, Newt," said
Matt, "and posted it in Steele, North Dakota. Murgatroyd
hasn't found it healthy to be in his Jamestown
office for some time, and the only person there, when
your letter was received, was your father. He recognized
your handwriting, and he opened the letter and
made a copy of it before he sent it on to Murgatroyd,
in Bismarck."</p>

<p>The broker's face became fairly livid. He tried to
talk, but the words gurgled in his throat.</p>

<p>"Your father knew I was a friend of his," pursued
Matt, "and he came to Fort Totten to see me. He got
there yesterday afternoon, driving over from Minnewaukon
in a heavy rain. When he showed me the
copy of your letter, I started for this place in the
aëroplane."</p>

<p>"What were you intending to do here?" inquired
Newt.</p>

<p>"I was hoping to persuade you to go back to Totten
and see your father. He wants you."</p>

<p>Newt shook his head.</p>

<p>"It won't do," he answered. "The old man and I had
a tumble, and it's better for us to keep apart."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>"You don't <i>dare</i> to go!" stormed Murgatroyd. "What
have I been paying you, for? Tell me that. You'll stay
away from Fort Totten, Newt. I've brought money
enough to take you to South America, and that's where
you're going."</p>

<p>Newt's eyes brightened a little.</p>

<p>"I wonder if you really mean to shell out enough to
take me that far?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," cried the broker, "and I'll pay you well for
going, too."</p>

<p>"You won't go, Newt," put in Matt. "You're not
going to let this scoundrel wheedle you into leaving the
country just to get you out of the way and prevent you
from telling what you know about the accident to Harry
Traquair."</p>

<p>Silence followed the launching of this bolt, silence that
was broken only by the startled breathing of the two
men. Both of them kept their eyes riveted on the prisoner.</p>

<p>"Traquair, the inventor of the aëroplane," continued
Matt, "tried out his machine in Jamestown, several weeks
ago, and an accident happened. Some part of the mechanism
broke. Why did it break?" Matt's voice grew
solemn as he turned his eyes on Murgatroyd. "Why did
it break?" he asked, again.</p>

<p>The broker's face turned ashen. Drops of sweat stood
out on his forehead, his hands clinched spasmodically,
and his lips moved without sound.</p>

<p>"Murgatroyd," Matt pursued mercilessly, "had a mortgage
on Harry Traquair's homestead, in Wells County.
For some reason of his own, Murgatroyd wants that
piece of prairie land. If Traquair had lived, he would
have sold his aëroplane to the government, and have paid
off the mortgage. But he didn't live, because a <i>supposed</i>
accident happened to his aëroplane."</p>

<p>The broker's lips were dry, and again and again he
moistened them with his tongue. The demons grew
harder, and brighter, and more merciless in his eyes.</p>

<p>The spark was doing well, but it had not yet been
advanced to the limit. It was the spark of friendship,
but it was coming into its own through devious ways.
The friendship was to be between poor old Prebbles and
his son; but it was to result in something else between
Newt and Murgatroyd, and prove powerful enough to
force the two apart.</p>

<p>"Murgatroyd has been paying you money, Newt," resumed
Matt, "to keep in the background and remain
silent about what you know. Is the scoundrel worth
protecting? Is it worth while to take hush money from
him? The bribes he has been giving you, he collected
from your father by means of duebills to which he had
forged your name."</p>

<p>Fierce anger flamed in Newt's face. Matt, seeing that
an explosion was close, hastened on.</p>

<p>"Your father is now lying ill at Fort Totten. It is
doubtful whether he can live&mdash;and he certainly cannot
unless you go back with me and be to him what you
have not been in the past&mdash;a son."</p>

<p>The red faded from Newt Prebbles' face and a deathly
pallor came in its stead. Stepping over to Matt, he
dropped both hands on his shoulders and looked him
steadily in the eyes.</p>

<p>"Motor Matt," said he, "are you telling me the truth
about my father? He is dangerously sick at Fort Totten?
Don't you lie to me," he warned fiercely.</p>

<p>"I am telling you the truth."</p>

<p>"And those forged I O U's&mdash;where did you learn about
them?"</p>

<p>"From your father, as I have already told you."</p>

<p>"It's like Murgatroyd," said Newt, between his teeth.
"He did want Traquair's homestead, because he happened
to discover that there is coal under the soil, and the
railroad company will buy the hundred and sixty at a
fancy price and run a spur track to it, so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The explosion came, at that moment, but it was not
as Matt expected. While Newt Prebbles stood facing
Matt, his back to the broker, there came the sound of
a blow.</p>

<p>Pain convulsed Newt's face for the fraction of a second,
his eyes closed, and he dropped senseless, overturning
Matt and his chair with the force of his fall.</p>

<p>Lying bound and helpless, Matt heard sounds of quick
footsteps, and saw Murgatroyd bending down over him.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">THE TRAIL TO THE RIVER.</p>


<p>Joe McGlory and Ping were in a fine good humor.
They had left the horses and rifles for the Tin Cup men
and, from the top of a distant hill, they had watched
the party recover the live stock and the guns. Then,
laughing and congratulating themselves, the boys had
ducked in among the cottonwoods of the creek bottom
and started along the trail to the river.</p>

<p>"Plenty fine," chattered Ping. "By Klismus, my gettee
heap fun this tlip. Woosh!"</p>

<p>"We played 'em to a fare-you-well," laughed McGlory,
pausing to extend his hand to Ping. "Shake, my little
heathen brother! You're the finest bit of the Yellow
Peril that ever landed in the U. S. You've got a head
on you, you have. Why, you savvied right off what I
wanted you to do with those guns, and I didn't have to
say a word."</p>

<p>"My savvy look you makee all same eye," chuckled
Ping. "Top-side pidgin! One piecee fine bizness."</p>

<p>Then, abruptly, Ping had a swift, paralyzing thought.</p>

<p>"Mebbyso Melican men makee chase fo' McGloly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Ping, huh?" he cried. "Plaps we lun, ketchee Matt, no
lettee Melican men ketchee us?"</p>

<p>"Oh, shucks, Ping!" exclaimed McGlory disgustedly.
"When you forget yourself, now and then, and do a
particularly bright thing, you spoil it all by some break
of that sort. Those punchers don't know where we're
going! And what sort of a trail are we leaving?" The
cowboy turned and looked back over the ground they
had covered. "All buffalo grass," he finished, "and the
Tin Cup outfit couldn't run us down in a thousand
years."</p>

<p>But Ping's fears persisted, in spite of McGlory's attempt
to smother them.</p>

<p>"My no likee," he quavered, pausing again and again
to look back as they traveled. "Mebbyso they ketchee,
they takee scalp. My no likee. Losee pigtail, no go
back to China ally mo'."</p>

<p>"Well, well, don't blubber about it!" exclaimed McGlory.
"You'll keep the pigtail, all right, though what
in Sam Hill it's good for is more than I know. Buck
up, step high, wide, and handsome, and don't lose so
much time looking around. Just stow it away in your
mind, Ping, that every step on the trail to the river
brings us that much closer to Pard Matt."</p>

<p>McGlory took the lead and set a brisk pace.</p>

<p>"Didn't Matt get away in great shape?" he called out,
as he strode along. "And that rope Spearman tied to
the machine didn't amount to a row of dobies."</p>

<p>"Cloud Joss heap fine fo' tlavel," remarked Ping.
"Feet tlavel plenty tough fo' China boy."</p>

<p>"I guess the circus we pulled off, back there on that
hill, was worth the price, Ping. Don't grumble. There
was something doing, and you and I answered to roll-call
during the height of the agitation. Little Chop Suey
and your Uncle Joe had something to say and do every
minute the curtain was up. Oh, shucks! I'm tickled to
death with myself. I'll be plumb contented, now, if nothing
happens to me for the next fifteen minutes. Wonder
how Matt's getting along, advancing that spark? Something
gives me a hunch and whispers in my ear that
he's having his hands full. Put your best foot forward,
Ping, and let's see how quick we can get to where we're
going."</p>

<p>"No gottee best foot," complained Ping. "Both feets
allee same bum. Cleek makee bend, makee bend, makee
bend; heap walkee to go li'l way."</p>

<p>"That's right," agreed McGlory. "Sufferin' serpents,
how the creek twists! Suppose we climb to the top of
this hill on the right and see if we can't work a cut-off
on the pesky stream."</p>

<p>"Awri'," agreed Ping, and followed McGlory to the
top of the hill.</p>

<p>From the crest they had an extensive view in every direction;
in fact, it was almost too extensive, for behind
them they glimpsed the Tin Cup men, racing back and
forth over the uplifts, scattered widely and hunting for
"signs."</p>

<p>McGlory muttered to himself and slipped off the top
of the hill like a shot. Ping gasped as he followed.</p>

<p>"They ketchee China boy," he wailed, "him losee pigtail."</p>

<p>"Oh, hush about that," growled McGlory. "Do you
know where we was lame, Ping?"</p>

<p>"My plenty lame in feet," said Ping.</p>

<p>"I mean, where we made a hobble. It was by not keeping
two of those horses and using them to take us to
the mouth of Burnt Creek."</p>

<p>"Woosh! We ketchee Matt now, Melican men follow
tlail, ketchee Matt, too. Motol Matt go top-side, we
all go top-side. Plenty bad pidgin."</p>

<p>"If they're really following us, which I don't think,"
remarked McGlory, "we'll fool 'em."</p>

<p>"No fool 'em twice."</p>

<p>"You watch. We'll take the longest way to the river
and get that bunch away from the creek."</p>

<p>Ping groaned at the thought of more walking. He
could have stood the journey better if he had not been
compelled to hang onto his grass sandals with his toes.</p>

<p>McGlory scuttled off between the coteaus, and every
once in a while he would climb to the top of a hill to
reconnoiter along the back track. Finally, to his great
satisfaction, he lost sight of the Tin Cup men.</p>

<p>"That means," said he, when he reported the fact to
Ping, "that we're free, once more, to get to the mouth
of Burnt Creek as soon as we can."</p>

<p>From that on there was little talking. The boys
needed their breath for the work before them. As before,
McGlory led the way and Ping hopped and scuffled
along behind him.</p>

<p>An occasional hill was scaled to get the bearings of
the creek and watch out for the river. McGlory gave
a shout of joy when he finally saw the broad ribbon of
muddy water in the distance ahead.</p>

<p>"We're close to where we're bound for, Ping," he
said cheerily. "We've been two or three hours on
the hike, but you trail along and I'll land you at the
junction of the creek and the river in less than twenty
minutes. Whoop-ya! I'm guessing about Matt. Has it
been make or break with him? And how has the spark
worked? I'm all stirred up with the notion that he's
having a time. Ever get a hunch like that and not be
able to explain how you got it?"</p>

<p>"No savvy hunch," groaned Ping. "Let's findee place
to makee sit in shade. Heap tired."</p>

<p>"We'll sit in the shade and rest and enjoy ourselves
after we find Matt. Keep a-moving, Ping, keep a-moving."</p>

<p>A pass between two hills brought them out into the
creek bottom again. The sun was getting low in the
west, but it was still uncomfortably warm, and the shade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
of the cottonwood trees was refreshing. Ping tottered
along with his eyes on McGlory's heels. Suddenly the
cowboy stopped and whirled around.</p>

<p>"Look!" he murmured, pointing.</p>

<p>The Chinaman swerved his weary eyes in the direction
indicated and saw the sod shack.</p>

<p>"Hoop-a-la!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I hear voices in there," whispered McGlory, "and
I'll bet Pard Matt's busy laying down the law to Newt
Prebbles. Let's not interrupt, but slip carefully up to
the door and get the lay of the land before we butt in."</p>

<p>Ping was for getting to a place of comfort and refreshment
in the shortest possible time; but, as usual, he
deferred to the superior wisdom of the cowboy.</p>

<p>Silently they stole toward the open door of the hut.
Through the opening there came to them the sound of a
voice. It was a strange voice, and the words were not
distinguishable.</p>

<p>While they were still some distance from the door, the
voice was blotted out by the impact of a blow; and immediately
there came a crash as of something being
overturned.</p>

<p>McGlory was no longer anxious to "get the lay of the
land" before butting into Matt's argument with Newt
Prebbles. In an instant he jumped for the door and
stood peering into the hut.</p>

<p>The scene before him was difficult to comprehend. A
chair had been overturned, and there was a form&mdash;no,
two forms&mdash;lying on the floor beside it. Then, too, there
was some one else, a man, bending over one of the
forms.</p>

<p>The dark interior of the shack was not favorable to a
clear survey of the scene by eyes but recently turned
from the glaring sunshine.</p>

<p>McGlory, however, caught one detail of the picture
that wrenched a sharp cry from his lips.</p>

<p>"Murgatroyd!" he shouted.</p>

<p>The bent form lifted itself with catlike quickness,
<i>Crack!</i> The sharp note of a revolver rattled through
the narrow room, followed by a warning shout in a
well-known voice:</p>

<p>"Look out, Joe! It's Murgatroyd, and he's in a killing
mood!"</p>

<p>Matt was in the room, bound and helpless. That was
the next detail that flashed before the eyes of McGlory.</p>

<p>Murgatroyd's shot had missed. Mad with rage, he
was making ready to fire again.</p>

<p>Blindly, desperately, the cowboy flung himself across
the room. Pard Matt was there, and in danger. Think
of himself, McGlory would not.</p>

<p>The demons in the broker's eyes glowered murderously
along the sights of the leveled weapon. It seemed
as though nothing could save the cowboy.</p>

<p>At just that moment, however, a window behind the
broker crashed inward. A stone, hurled by Ping with all
his force, had shattered the glass, plunged across the
gap, and struck Murgatroyd's arm.</p>

<p>The arm dropped as though paralyzed, and the broker
staggered sideways with a cry of pain. McGlory sprang
upon him, and the two were struggling fiercely when
Ping raced into the room and took a hand in the battle.</p>

<p>Murgatroyd, with only one hand, was no match for
his wiry young antagonists.</p>

<p>As Newt and Murgatroyd had overpowered Matt, so
the cowboy and the Chinaman wrestled and secured the
advantage of Murgatroyd.</p>

<p>One of the forms on the floor slowly lifted itself
and became busy with the cords around Matt's wrists.</p>

<p>"I can do the rest, Newt," said Matt, sitting up and
freeing his ankles.</p>

<p>A few moments more and the tables had been completely
turned. Murgatroyd was now the prisoner, and
the king of the motor boys and his friends were in command
of the situation.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">UNWELCOME CALLERS.</p>


<p>Once more, during the course of that eventful day,
Ping was to be congratulated on his quickness and wit.
McGlory had gone to the door to make his survey of
what was transpiring inside the sod shack, and Ping
had approached a window. The revolver shot caused
the Chinese boy to jump, and to debate in his startled
mind whether it would be better to run, or to hold his
ground. He held his ground and used the stone&mdash;to the
lasting benefit of Joe McGlory.</p>

<p>Now, at last, it seemed, the brawling and the violence
was over. Murgatroyd lay in the place where Matt
had lain, Newt Prebbles was bathing his injured head
in a basin of cool water, and Matt, McGlory, and Ping
were sitting down and explaining to each other how
everything had happened.</p>

<p>"You were foolish to talk like you did to Murgatroyd,
when he had the best of you, Matt," said McGlory.</p>

<p>"He didn't have the best of me," asserted Matt. "I
had made a friend by that talk, and the friend was Newt
Prebbles."</p>

<p>"That's the truth," spoke up Newt, turning his head
for a look at Matt.</p>

<p>"Well, then," bristled McGlory, "maybe you'll explain
why you helped Murgatroyd down Matt, in the first
place?"</p>

<p>"I was to blame there," answered Newt, "but I didn't
understand the situation. Everything had been sprung
on me all of a heap, as you might say, and I was dazed
and bewildered. Murgatroyd had come here because I
had written and asked him to. He had money for me,
as I supposed, and I considered myself in duty bound to
help him. Later, when Motor Matt did his talking, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
discovered some things which put up the bars between
Murgatroyd and me. That last thump on the head,
of course, topped off the whole affair. Murgatroyd was
crazy mad, that's all. He hit me with something harder
than his bare knuckles. Was it the handle of his revolver?"</p>

<p>"Maybe it was this," and McGlory leaned forward and
picked a pair of brass knuckle dusters off the clay floor.</p>

<p>"That's what he used," declared Prebbles.</p>

<p>"I have always feared," said Matt, "that our dealings
with Murgatroyd would end in some violent work, like
this. And it was all for a hundred and sixty acres of
coal land, which would have netted Murgatroyd only a
few thousand dollars, at the most!"</p>

<p>The broker's anger had vanished with his capture,
and left him miserable in spirit; but, even now, while
his fortunes were at lowest ebb, his crafty mind led him
to think of some way out of his troubles.</p>

<p>"You've got me," said he, with a bitter laugh. "I
didn't think you lads could do it, but you've turned the
trick. Are you any better off?"</p>

<p>"Speak to me about that!" muttered McGlory. "Matt's
a heap better off. I don't know what you were going to
do, when Ping and I showed up, but I'm feeling a whole
lot easier to have this matter just as it is."</p>

<p>"So am I better off," put in Newt Prebbles. "I've led
a hard life, and I've been a hard man, but I'm the only
one to blame for that. And I know this: Association
with Amos Murgatroyd, for any length of time, is an
excellent passport to the penitentiary."</p>

<p>"That's right, Newt," said the broker scathingly.
"You know on which side your bread is buttered. Get
on the side of the winning team, by all means. But I
wasn't talking to you or McGlory, but to Motor Matt."</p>

<p>His voice changed to a pleading tone.</p>

<p>"I'm wrecked, Motor Matt," he went on, "if you turn
me over to the authorities. There's nothing in my past
life that's so very criminal. Of course, knowing what
I did about the Traquair homestead, I was anxious to
get hold of it. But that's out of my power, now. You've
been put to a good deal of inconvenience, but I'll make
that all up to you in dollars and cents if you'll take
these ropes off me and let me clear out."</p>

<p>"You say," said Matt, "that there's nothing in your
past that is so very criminal. If that's so, why are you
afraid to face the music? Why do you want to shirk the
consequences?"</p>

<p>"Even a short term of imprisonment will ruin my loan
business," answered Murgatroyd. "I have built that
business up very carefully, and I hate to see it go to
smash. I tell you what I'll do. If you'll release me,
I'll wipe out that mortgage of one thousand dollars which
I hold on the Traquair homestead, and I'll give you and
your friends a thousand apiece, all around. What do
you say?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry for you, Murgatroyd," said Matt, "but I
haven't any authority to set you free, even if I was inclined
that way. It's the government that wants you;
and the government wants you so much that a price has
been placed on your head. You've danced, and now
you've got to pay the fiddler."</p>

<p>"He says he hasn't done anything so very criminal,"
remarked Newt Prebbles, as he tied a handkerchief
around his head. "I'd like to know what he calls criminal."</p>

<p>"Well," sneered the broker, "I haven't been bribed for
keeping what I know away from the authorities."</p>

<p>"As I was bribed," retorted Newt hotly, "with money
my own father paid you for forged duebills!"</p>

<p>Murgatroyd laughed, and it was the laugh of a wretch
utterly devoid of conscience.</p>

<p>"That <i>was</i> rather a neat play of mine," said he. "But
you haven't given me your answer yet, Motor Matt."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have," said Matt. "You're going to Fort
Totten."</p>

<p>"And so am I," put in Newt Prebbles, "just as quick
as I can get there. I'll take Murgatroyd's horse and
ride to Bismarck. There's a night train I can catch for
Jamestown, and I ought to be at the post some time before
noon, to-morrow."</p>

<p>"You can't get there any too quick," observed McGlory
caustically.</p>

<p>He had no liking for Newt Prebbles. A man who
would do what Newt Prebbles had done could never
stand very high in the cowboy's estimation.</p>

<p>"You'd better watch that fellow, Motor Matt," called
Murgatroyd. "He'll not go to the post, but will clear
out for parts unknown."</p>

<p>"He'll go to the post, I'm sure of it," said Matt.</p>

<p>"I will," declared Newt. "My father and I never
agreed very well, but I guess that was my fault, too.
When you leave here, Motor Matt, just lock the door
and bring the key. I don't know whether I'll ever come
back to this shack or not&mdash;I don't think I will, as I feel
now&mdash;but it will be well for me to have the key. Good-by."</p>

<p>He stepped toward the king of the motor boys and
extended his hand.</p>

<p>"Haven't you forgotten something, Newt?" inquired
Matt.</p>

<p>Prebbles gave him a blank look. The next moment he
understood what Matt had reference to, and pulled a
jingling bag from his pocket and tossed it upon the
table.</p>

<p>"That's the whole of it," he said. "You'll see that it
is returned?"</p>

<p>Matt nodded.</p>

<p>"That means that I'll have to walk to Totten, or ride
Murgatroyd's horse," Prebbles added, as he moved toward
the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>Matt was about to lend him the money for his railroad
ticket, when a form darkened the door and stepped into
the room.</p>

<p>"Goin' somewheres?" queried a voice. "Well, I
wouldn't, George&mdash;not jest yet."</p>

<p>It was Jed Spearman. Behind him came Slim, and
back of Slim trailed the cowboy who had been referred
to as "Hen."</p>

<p>Matt, greatly alarmed, sprang up and stepped forward.</p>

<p>"Don't lay a hand on that man, Spearman," said
Matt. "His father is sick at Fort Totten, and he's got
to go there in a hurry."</p>

<p>"Oh, ho!" guffawed the foreman. "If here ain't Motor
Matt, who was flyin' this way on gov'ment bizness! An'
the chink that run off with the guns, an' t'other chap
as lit out with our live stock. Waal, now, ain't this
here a pleasin' surprise&mdash;fer us? Don't git vi'lent, any
o' ye. Three o' us is in here, and thar's three more
watchin' on the outside. I reckon the boot's on the
other leg, this deal, hey, Slim?"</p>

<p>"I reckon," agreed Slim. "This is a whole lot funnier
than that other game, over on the coteau."</p>

<p>"Don't ye ask us ter put down our guns an' do no
more pushin'," said Spearman. "Ye kain't work that
joke on us twicet, hand-runnin'. We've cut our eyeteeth,
we hev. Got any weppins among ye?"</p>

<p>Newt Prebbles, glaring at the Tin Cup men, had
backed into a corner. He had his eye on the broken
window, and Spearman observed his intention.</p>

<p>"Don't ye never try <i>that</i>, George," he grinned. "Ye'd
be riddled like a salt shaker afore ye'd hit the ground."</p>

<p>"Spearman," said Matt, "you don't understand this
matter. If you did&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thar was some parts o' it I didn't onderstand none
too well, back thar on the hill, a few hours ago. But
ye heered me say we'd cut our eyeteeth, didn't ye? I
meant jest that."</p>

<p>"I came here on government duty, just as I said," went
on Matt, "and if you interfere with me in any way,
you'll regret it."</p>

<p>"Will I? Waal, life is plumb full o' sorrers an' regrets.
Who's the gent on the floor?"</p>

<p>"I'm a helpless victim of these young scoundrels,"
said Murgatroyd plaintively. "Release me, gentlemen,
and do an act of simple justice!"</p>

<p>"His name is Murgatroyd," corrected Matt, "and the
government has offered a reward of a thousand dollars
for his capture."</p>

<p>"That's your story fer it, young man. I ain't takin'
your word fer nothin'. Slim, step over an' cut the gent
loose."</p>

<p>Slim started. Matt stepped in front of him.</p>

<p>"Leave that man alone!" ordered Matt. "You fellows,
I suppose," he continued, turning to Spearman,
"have come here after the money Prebbles took from you
at the ranch. He was leaving it with me to deliver to
you, just as you came."</p>

<p>"Likely yarn," scoffed Jed Spearman, taking a chair
in the doorway. "Consider yerselves pris'ners, all o' ye.
We ain't so terribly het up over Motor Matt, and we
ain't so mad at t'other feller or the chink as we mout
be, seein' as how they left us our hosses an' guns an'
then trailed straight fer this place whar we diskiver
George Hobbes. It's Hobbes we want, an' I tell ye plain
we're goin' ter play bob with him afore we're done.
That's flat."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">AN UNEXPECTED TURN.</p>


<p>Motor Matt was never more at sea than he was at
that moment. What could he, and McGlory, and Ping do
against six armed cowboys who, because of their hostility,
would not listen to reason?</p>

<p>Jed Spearman and his companions could do exactly as
they pleased. They could take the law into their own
hands, so far as Newt Prebbles was concerned, and
delay his departure for Fort Totten; and, in reckless defiance
of what Matt said, they could release Murgatroyd.</p>

<p>Ping, so far from being a factor of strength in the
slender force to be mustered against the cowboys, was
a decided element of weakness. He was afraid he was
going to lose his queue, and the fear had made him
almost daft.</p>

<p>"Slim," called Spearman, tilting back in his chair and
fanning himself with his hat, "jest count the <i>dinero</i> in
that bag an' see how much it foots up."</p>

<p>Slim slouched over to the table, Matt, meanwhile,
standing guard between him and Murgatroyd.</p>

<p>With elaborate ease, Slim dumped the contents of the
pouch on the table and proceeded to count the gold
pieces.</p>

<p>"Why, Jed," he called, "I'm blamed if it ain't all here,
an' a dollar more'n what we lost."</p>

<p>"Keep the dollar fer int'rest, Slim," said Spearman
generously. "Tell me, Hen," he proceeded, "what we're
goin' ter do to the low-down tinhorn who run in them
fancy tricks on us at the bunk house?"</p>

<p>"Hang 'im," replied Hen promptly.</p>

<p>"Oh, ye're altogether too desp'rit. Somethin' lighter'n
that. What say, Slim?"</p>

<p>"Waal," replied Slim, "I'd suggest runnin' him out o'
the kentry, Jed. We ain't got no room, in these parts,
fer a robber like what this feller is. The law kain't
tech him, ye know."</p>

<p>"Hev we got ter waste our vallyble time pusson'ly conductin'
sich a missable galoot across the border?" asked
Spearman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thar's a hoss among the cottonwoods, Jed. Let's tie
the tinhorn ter his back, take off the hoss' bridle, an'
then chase the critter fer a ways. That 'u'd do the
trick."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," came the imploring voice of Murgatroyd,
"that animal belongs to me. I beg of you not
to use him in your scheme of punishment. How shall
I get back to Bismarck after you release me?"</p>

<p>"Stop yer talkin', you!" scowled Spearman. "I reckon,
if we turn ye loose, that ort ter be about all ye kin ask.
Slim," he added to his comrade, "yer suggestion is in
good taste, an' hes my approval. The trick hes been
done afore, an' allers, I make no doubt, with good an'
lastin' effects ter the community. Pris'ner, hev ye got
anythin' ter say?"</p>

<p>"Only this," replied Newt Prebbles. "My father is
lying sick at Fort Totten. He needs me. If you try
to tie me to that horse and send me across the border,
I'll fight till I drop. What more do you want?" he
cried passionately. "I gambled with you, and I resorted
to a gambler's tricks, but I have returned more money
than I took."</p>

<p>"Ye returned the money bekase ye had ter," said
Spearman grimly. "If us fellers hadn't blowed in here,
we wouldn't 'a' got it."</p>

<p>"You're wrong there, Spearman," called Matt. "I
have told you once, and I repeat it now, that Prebbles
gave up that moment before he, or any of the rest of us,
knew you were coming here. I protest against such inhuman
treatment as you're planning to give him."</p>

<p>"All right," grinned Spearman, "protest. Now, we'll
let that drap while we consider the case o' the gent on
the floor. I reckon, Motor Matt, ye're plumb anxious ter
take him ter Totten, ain't ye?"</p>

<p>"I am," answered Matt. "As I told you, he's wanted
by the government."</p>

<p>"It 'u'd be a feather in yer cap if ye toted him in,
wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about that, and I don't care.
He's a scoundrel, and ought to be punished."</p>

<p>"An' thar's a thousand out fer him?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Which ye'd git?"</p>

<p>"No. It goes to another man."</p>

<p>Spearman drew down an eyelid in a knowing wink.</p>

<p>"'Course I ain't swallerin' that, not noways. It was
right funny, that thing ye done over on the hill. I
reckon ye've laughed a-considerable about that, hey? I
didn't git a chance ter fly with ye, an' the boys hev been
joshin' me ever sence about it. Ye ort ter be punished
somehow, an' I reckon the easiest and best way ter do
that is by letting yer pris'ner go. Ye won't hev no
feather in yer cap, an' ye won't hev no thousand dollars.
Slim!"</p>

<p>"On deck, Jed."</p>

<p>"I ordered ye, a while ago, ter let that man loose.
Now, I order ye ag'in. This time, I want it done!"</p>

<p>"Wait a second!" cried Matt. "Spearman," he went
on, "are you such a fool you think you can punish me
by allowing this man his freedom?"</p>

<p>"Keerful!" warned the foreman. "Don't git ter callin'
names. I won't stand fer that, not fer a minit."</p>

<p>"If you allow this criminal to go, you'll be getting
yourself into hot water&mdash;you won't be hurting me."</p>

<p>"I know what I'm about. Slim!"</p>

<p>Slim started toward Motor Matt, swinging one hand
carelessly but significantly behind him.</p>

<p>"Keep away," said Matt, a dangerous light rising in
his eyes. "You'll not let this man go."</p>

<p>"Are you going to let yourself be bluffed by a fellow
of his size?" taunted Murgatroyd, taking another tack.</p>

<p>"No words from you," growled Spearman.</p>

<p>Slim undoubtedly felt that it was up to him to let the
foreman and Hen know what he was good for. He had
a natural delicacy about using a weapon against an unarmed
youth, so he made the mistake of thinking he
could eliminate the barrier with his hands.</p>

<p>"Side-step!" he commanded.</p>

<p>Matt held his ground.</p>

<p>"Waal, if ye won't, then take that."</p>

<p>Slim swung his fist. What happened, then, must have
astonished him exceedingly.</p>

<p>His fist clove the empty air, and before he could recover
his poise he was struck a blow that heaved him over
against Hen, and toppled both of them against the wall.</p>

<p>"Jumpin' jee-mimy!" stuttered Slim, rubbing his chin.
"He hits like the kick of a mule&mdash;an' it was about as
quick."</p>

<p>"Oh, blazes!" growled Spearman, in disgust. "Hen,
you help. If the two o' ye ain't enough, I'll join in."</p>

<p>McGlory had pressed closer to Matt's side. The two
chums were now shoulder to shoulder.</p>

<p>"I'm a cowboy myself," cried McGlory, "and if you
longhorns have come out prancin' for trouble, I guess we
can accommodate you."</p>

<p>But the matter was never brought to an issue. A
shrill whistle echoed from the outside. Spearman
jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>"That's from one o' our boys," said he. "What's
doin'?"</p>

<p>The next moment Spearman knew. A khaki-clad
officer appeared in the doorway, covered with the dust of
a hard ride. Standing there, for an instant, he surveyed
the interior of the shack.</p>

<p>"Cameron!" cried Matt joyfully.</p>

<p>"Whoop-ya!" roared McGlory. "Lieutenant Cameron,
of the old U. S. A. Speak to me about that! He's just
in time."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who's Leftenant Cameron?" snorted Spearman. "I
don't know him from Adam."</p>

<p>"Possibly not," answered Cameron, "but, fortunately,
I've got a man with me whom you do know. Come in,
Roscoe!" called the lieutenant, stepping farther into the
room.</p>

<p>A burly individual slouched through the doorway and
stood looking out from under his bushy brows at Spearman.</p>

<p>The foreman's careless air left him in a flash. He
fell back a step.</p>

<p>"Roscoe!"</p>

<p>"Surest thing you know," replied the burly individual,
"Roscoe, Sheriff of Burleigh. Now, what's been going
on here?"</p>

<p>There was something humorous, after that, in Spearman's
attempt to explain. The whole story was finally
given by Matt, and listened to with attention.</p>

<p>The sheriff, when all the details were in, drew a large
slab of tobacco from his pocket and nibbled off a corner.</p>

<p>"Who's got the money that was won at the bunk
house?" he asked calmly.</p>

<p>"Slim, thar," answered Spearman.</p>

<p>"Fork over, Slim."</p>

<p>Slim promptly tossed the bag to Roscoe.</p>

<p>"If you Tin Cup men haven't got sense enough to keep
from being skinned," remarked the sheriff, "you ought to
be done out of your eyeteeth. And, furthermore, you
haven't any call to chase the man that was too sharp for
you and try to run him out of the country. You fellows
at the Tin Cup are a heap too lawless. I've had my eye
on you for quite a spell. The money goes to the man
that took it. Here, stranger! I'm not approving of the
way it was come by, mark you, but, so far as the ethics
of this case are concerned, the money is yours."</p>

<p>"I don't want it," was the astounding response from
Newt Prebbles. "I'm a different man from what I was
when I got that away from the Tin Cup fellows."</p>

<p>The sheriff stared, then calmly dropped the bag into
his own pocket.</p>

<p>"I'll accept the donation," said he, "and pass it along
to the Bismarck Orphan Asylum. Now, Spearman," and
he stepped over and tapped the foreman on the chest, "I
wish I could take you to town with me for planning to
release a badly wanted man. But I can't. All I can
say is that I've got my eye on you. Scatter out of this.
That will be about all."</p>

<p>The Tin Cup men "scattered." As the galloping hoofs
died away in the distance, Lieutenant Cameron stepped
over and caught Matt's hand.</p>

<p>"I guess I was of some use, after all, eh, Matt? You
fellows have had most of the fun, but I managed to get
here in time to save you some unpleasantness."</p>

<p>"You did," answered Motor Matt gratefully, wringing
the brave fellow's hand. "You've saved the prisoner,
and made it possible for Prebbles' son to get to the post
in time to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait," interrupted Cameron, pulling a yellow slip
from his pocket. "That reached me just as the sheriff
and I were leaving Bismarck."</p>

<p>Matt took the telegram. It was brief, but terribly to
the point.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Prebbles can't last more than twenty-four hours, at
the outside. Useless to bring his son."</p></blockquote>

<p>This was signed by the doctor. Silently Matt passed
the telegram to Newt.</p>

<p>Young Prebbles read it, dropped into a chair, and
buried his face in his hands.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">A RISKY VENTURE.</p>


<p>While Roscoe was removing the ropes from Murgatroyd's
hands and replacing them with a pair of steel
manacles, Matt and McGlory stepped out of the shack
for a brief talk.</p>

<p>"Young Prebbles is pretty badly cut up," said Cameron.</p>

<p>"He ought to be," said McGlory. "I reckon this is a
lesson for him, and for any other young fellow who
feels like taking the bit in his teeth."</p>

<p>"It's pretty tough," murmured Matt, shaking his head.
"There's good stuff in young Prebbles."</p>

<p>"That's Pard Matt for you, Cameron," said the cowboy.
"He always looks for the good stuff in a fellow
and never sees much of anything else."</p>

<p>"After all," approved Cameron, "that's the best way.
But I'll warrant Matt can't find much to commend in
Murgatroyd."</p>

<p>"He's old enough to know right from wrong," said
Matt, "and now that he's made his bed, he's got to lie
in it. Where did you find the sheriff, Cameron?"</p>

<p>"Wired him I was coming, and he met me at the train
with a couple of riding horses. They couldn't remember
anything definite at the post office, although one of
the clerks had a hazy recollection that some one had
called for a letter addressed to Hobbes. That's all we
had to go on. We hit the trail and rode hard."</p>

<p>"Good thing you did. If you hadn't ridden so hard
you might have got here too late."</p>

<p>"What a day this has been! I should think you fellows
would be about fagged."</p>

<p>Before Matt could make any response, Newt Prebbles
came out of the shack.</p>

<p>"I'm going, just the same," said he doggedly.</p>

<p>"There's no way you can get to the post in time, Prebbles,"
returned Cameron kindly.</p>

<p>"I'll get there, anyhow, whether I'm late or not. Good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
heavens! You don't understand what this means to me!
You don't know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He bit his lips to keep back the emotion that grew
with the words.</p>

<p>"I've just got to go," he finished. "I'll get through
somehow."</p>

<p>"How'll you get from here to Bismarck?" inquired
Cameron.</p>

<p>"On Murgatroyd's horse."</p>

<p>"Your connections are poor all the way through.
You'll not be able to reach Totten before to-morrow
afternoon."</p>

<p>"I'm going."</p>

<p>"Wait," said Matt. "Are you willing to take a little
risk, Prebbles?"</p>

<p>"Risk? I'd take any risk if it could shorten my trip
to Totten by a single hour."</p>

<p>"Do you know the country between here and Totten?"</p>

<p>"Every foot of it."</p>

<p>"By night as well as by day?"</p>

<p>"Any time."</p>

<p>"Let's get a little something to eat," said Matt, "and
then I'll agree to get you to Totten inside of three hours."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"We'll use the aëroplane."</p>

<p>There was a silence, then a protest from McGlory.</p>

<p>"Pard, you're not made of iron. You can't stand that
trip, after all you've done. Sufferin' cats! Why, you're
workin' every second you're runnin' the <i>Comet</i>! And it's
the hardest kind of work, at that."</p>

<p>"I can do it," said Matt, looking around at the gathering
dusk. "But we'll have to start before it gets too
dark."</p>

<p>"Look at the risk!"</p>

<p>"We'll face it. Besides, it's not so much."</p>

<p>There was no arguing with Matt. He had his mind
made up and was like a rock.</p>

<p>"You and Ping, Joe," said Matt, "will come with Cameron
and Murgatroyd. Have you a lantern, Newt?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Get it."</p>

<p>The lantern was secured and lighted. After Matt had
hastily bolted a few mouthfuls of food, he took the lantern
and started for the place where he had left the
<i>Comet</i>.</p>

<p>Cameron, Ping, and McGlory accompanied the king of
the motor boys and Newt Prebbles. Roscoe remained at
the shack with Murgatroyd.</p>

<p>The rope with which the aëroplane had been made fast
to the trees was taken off, and Matt, while he was going
over the machine to see that everything was in proper
order, told McGlory to hunt for a favorable place to
make the start.</p>

<p>When Matt had finished his inspection, the cowboy
had selected the nearest spot which was at all promising.</p>

<p>"It's at the top of the bank, Matt," said McGlory.
"There's a clear stretch, sloping slightly to the east."</p>

<p>"Then let's get the machine up there."</p>

<p>The <i>Comet</i>, a ghostly monstrosity in the gloom, was
pushed and pulled to the top of the bank and pointed
down the slight slope. Matt walked over the course of
the start with the lantern, to make sure there were no
stones in the way.</p>

<p>"We don't want the lantern," said Matt, coming back
and handing the light to McGlory. "Lock up the shack
when you leave and bring the key with you, Joe."</p>

<p>McGlory was nervous and apprehensive. He grabbed
Matt's hand before he took his seat.</p>

<p>"It's a risky venture," he breathed.</p>

<p>"A little risk, of course," answered Matt. "There always
is."</p>

<p>"But this is night, pard. You never tried to fly the
machine at night before."</p>

<p>"There's always got to be a first time."</p>

<p>"There's some wind, too."</p>

<p>"Not enough to be dangerous."</p>

<p>"You'll win out, Motor Matt," said Cameron; "you
always do."</p>

<p>"There's got to be a first time when he won't,"
croaked McGlory dismally.</p>

<p>"Take your seat, Newt," said Matt.</p>

<p>Newt, without a word, placed himself as directed.</p>

<p>"I guess we're all ready," called Matt, starting the
motor. "Help us in the getaway, you fellows."</p>

<p>Cameron, McGlory, and Ping pushed the car down
the slope through the dusk. Finally it drew away from
them, and they saw it, like a huge spectre, sailing skyward.</p>

<p>Newt Prebbles undoubtedly remembered more about
that daring night trip than Motor Matt.</p>

<p>The king of the motor boys had eyes and ears for
nothing but his work. The propeller whirled the great
planes on and on into the gloom, and sense of touch
alone told Matt when to meet the varying points of air
pressure by a shift of the wing tips.</p>

<p>Newt said little, and what he did say was in the nature
of directions for keeping the <i>Comet</i> on the right course.
With eyes peering ahead and downward, he watched the
dusky panorama flitting away below them.</p>

<p>Matt admired his courage. Calm and steady, he kept
rigidly to his place, interfered in no way with the freedom
of Matt's movements, and watched alertly for the
landmarks with which he was familiar.</p>

<p>Whenever they swept over a cluster of lights, young
Prebbles named the town instantly.</p>

<p>The stars came out in the dusky vault overhead, and
a big moon crept up over the horizon.</p>

<p>Swinging through space, hung from the zenith as by
invisible cords, the <i>Comet</i> glided steadily and surely
onward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oberon," announced Newt, as they swept across a
gleaming mat of yellow.</p>

<p>"Great spark plugs!" exclaimed the king of the motor
boys. "I don't know, Newt, but I've a notion we're
making a record flight."</p>

<p>"It's wonderful," mused young Prebbles; "but there's
something which, to my mind, is even more wonderful
than this work of the flying machine."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"Why, that you're doing this for me&mdash;for a man who
nearly drowned himself trying to get away from you,
and who tried his best to cripple you, or the <i>Comet</i>, with
a bullet."</p>

<p>"We all of us make mistakes, now and then," answered
Matt. "It's a mighty foolish man who won't rectify a
mistake when he finds he has made one."</p>

<p>From Oberon the course led north and east.</p>

<p>"There's the post trader's store," reported Prebbles.</p>

<p>"That means we're just about where we're going," said
Matt.</p>

<p>"Where'll we come down?"</p>

<p>"On the parade ground at the post."</p>

<p>When near the old fort, they could hear the call of
the sentries, and were able to mark the fringe of oil
lamps around the barracks and officers' quarters.</p>

<p>Silently, like a wraith from the Unknown, they dropped
downward, struck on the bicycle wheels, and glided to
a stop.</p>

<p>"Be hivins," cried a voice, "it's th' <i>Comet</i>. Now what
would you be afther thinkin' av that? Th' <i>Comet</i>, d'ye
moind, rammin' around in th' dark th' same as if it was
broad day. Is that yerself, Motor Matt?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Matt, stepping out of the machine. "How's
Prebbles, O'Hara?"</p>

<p>"Th' ould sawbones has given up hope, an' that's all
I kin tell ye. But who is it ye have along?"</p>

<p>"Prebbles' son. Take him up to Cameron's quarters
at once, will you?"</p>

<p>"Sure I will."</p>

<p>"I'll see you in the morning, Newt," Matt added.</p>

<p>Young Prebbles paused to grasp Matt's hand.</p>

<p>"I appreciate what you have done for me, don't forget
that," he said.</p>

<p>Matt gave the <i>Comet</i> into the care of a guard, then
hunted up a place to sleep. His head had hardly dropped
on the pillow before he was off for the land of dreams.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">CONCLUSION.</p>


<p>Doctors are not infallible, and the post doctor was no
exception in this respect. All his experience and skill in
diagnosing the ills of humanity, made him certain that
Prebbles was booked for the other world. But there was
an error&mdash;and, more than likely, that error was due to
the arrival of Newt, who, it will be remembered, the
doctor had wired it would be useless to send.</p>

<p>Prebbles was singing his Salvation Army hymns when
Newt stepped into the sick room. All night he was
marching the streets, in his disordered mind, pounding
the cymbals and exhorting. Occasionally there crept into
the oral wanderings a reference to the young man watching
at the bedside.</p>

<p>Most unexpectedly&mdash;most unaccountably, to the doctor&mdash;a
lucid moment came to Prebbles in the early morning.
He saw his son, he recognized him, and he felt
his handclasp. There was a smile on the old man's
lips as he drifted back into his sea of visions.</p>

<p>But, from that moment, there was a noticeable change.
There seemed more resisting power in the wasted body of
the old clerk, as though hope for better things had
grown up in him and was giving him strength.</p>

<p>To Matt, Newt Prebbles told what he knew about the
accident to poor Harry Traquair.</p>

<p>Siwash Charley, under agreement with Murgatroyd,
had tampered with Traquair's machine before the fatal
flight, just as he had tampered with Matt's machine before
the official trials at Fort Totten. But Traquair had
not been so fortunate as the king of the motor boys.</p>

<p>Newt had learned of this villainous work through
Siwash Charley, and had received from Siwash, at a
time when the ruffian was under the influence of liquor,
an incriminating note from the broker, signed with his
<i>alias</i>, "George Hobbes."</p>

<p>Prebbles had made use of this document, holding it
over Murgatroyd's head and extorting money from him
on account of it.</p>

<p>This, of course, formed a sad commentary on the
character of young Prebbles. But Motor Matt, in "advancing
the spark of friendship," so played upon the facts
in the case, and showed up the broker's duplicity, that
the old clerk's illness formed the turning point in his
son's career.</p>

<p>Such transformations are not so rare as it would seem.</p>

<p>Cameron, Matt, Ping, and Roscoe arrived at the post
in the afternoon following the arrival of Matt and young
Prebbles. Murgatroyd, of course, accompanied them.</p>

<p>Murgatroyd was tried, not on the Traquair charge, but
on the later one of conniving, with Siwash Charley, to
injure the aëroplane at the government trials, thus endangering
the life, not only of Motor Matt, but of Lieutenant
Cameron as well.</p>

<p>His sentence was commensurate with the evil he had
attempted, and he followed Siwash Charley to the Leavenworth
prison.</p>

<p>After a few days the post doctor was as certain Prebbles
would recover as he had been positive, at the time
he sent his message to Cameron, that he had not many
hours to live.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>The reward paid by the government for the capture
of Murgatroyd was made over to the old clerk. On
this, he and his son were to begin life anew.</p>

<p>One of the first things Matt did, after reaching the
post with Newt Prebbles, was to write to Mrs. Traquair,
at Jamestown, settling a mystery which had long puzzled
every one who knew of Murgatroyd's attempts to secure
the Wells County homestead.</p>

<p>There was coal under the soil of the quarter-section,
and the railroad company wanted it. That was the secret,
and Mrs. Traquair profited handsomely by the
knowledge of it.</p>

<p>The mortgage was paid, and the homestead passed into
the hands of the railroad company.</p>

<p>In a country so barren of trees as North Dakota, coal
is a valuable commodity.</p>

<p>Matt still kept the aëroplane, and still persistently refused
to put it in storage at the post, to be called for
later.</p>

<p>"The <i>Comet</i>," said Matt, one evening when he and
McGlory were again with Cameron, "has got to earn
something for Joe, and Ping, and myself."</p>

<p>"Ping comes in on the deal, does he?" laughed Cameron.</p>

<p>"Share and share alike with the rest of us," averred
Matt. "That Chinese boy is loyalty itself. Down in
that shelter tent, below the post trader's, he spends his
nights and days watching the aëroplane."</p>

<p>"And talking to it, and singing about it, and burning
rice-paper prayers to the heathen josses, asking them
to keep it carefully and not let it go broke while up
in the air," put in McGlory. "Oh, he's a freak, that
Ping boy; but, as Matt says, he's a mighty good sort of
a freak at that. Look how he ran off with the rifles
when we fooled the Tin Cup punchers on the hill! And
remember how he slammed that stone through the window
when Murgatroyd had drawn a fine bead on me
and was about to press the trigger. Share and share
alike? Well, I should say."</p>

<p>"You're still determined to go into the show business,
Matt?" asked Cameron anxiously.</p>

<p>"I don't see why we shouldn't," said Matt. "Five
hundred a week isn't to be sneezed at. Joe's agreed, and
so has Ping. When the first favorable day arrives, we're
going to fly to Fargo."</p>

<p>Two days later the favorable moment was at hand.
All the soldiers at the post were out to witness the start,
and even the gruff post trader was present to say good-by
to the king of the motor boys and his friends.</p>

<p>Matt's last call, at the post, was made on Prebbles.
The old man was practically out of danger, but his recovery
would take time, and for a long while yet he
would have to remain in bed.</p>

<p>He was not able to say much, but what little he did
say Matt considered an ample reward for the strenuous
adventures that had befallen him and his chums on their
flight to the upper Missouri.</p>

<p>Newt had become his sworn friend. Whenever Matt
wanted any help, in any way that was within Newt's
power to grant, he was surely to call on young Prebbles.</p>

<p>When finally Motor Matt took his way down the post
hill for the last time, he was in an exceedingly thoughtful
mood.</p>

<p>He remembered when he had first come to Devil's
Lake, knowing nothing about aëroplanes, and had practiced
with the <i>June Bug</i> until he had acquired the knack
of flying the machine and had made good and sold the
machine to the government for enough to give large
profit to himself and his friends, and, what pleased him
most, to place Mrs. Traquair above want.</p>

<p>He remembered, too, how he had sailed away alone
into Wells County on a fool's errand, had become entangled
in a losing cause, and had experienced a sharp
reverse.</p>

<p>But, best of all, in his estimation, was the night
journey back to the post from the Missouri River, bringing
Newt Prebbles to his father's bedside.</p>

<p>Down into the cheering throng below the post trader's
store went the king of the motor boys, shaking hands
with every one he met, Indians, whites, or "breeds,"
receiving good wishes from all and heartily returning
them.</p>

<p>For the last time the aëroplane was dragged from
the shelter tent, given a strong start along the old
familiar roadway, and then watched as it climbed up
and up into the air and winged swiftly eastward, carrying
Motor Matt, and Joe McGlory, and Ping into untried
ventures and fresh fields of endeavor.</p>

<h2><a name="MOSE_HOWARDS_FISH_TRAP" id="MOSE_HOWARDS_FISH_TRAP">MOSE HOWARD'S FISH TRAP.</a></h2>


<p>Nicodemus Squab, Professor of Orthography in the Jimtown
district school, was a man of an inquiring turn of mind.</p>

<p>Overhearing some of the scholars discussing a prospective
coon hunt that was to come off the following Saturday night,
the professor drew near and inquired if they would allow
him to join them.</p>

<p>"Of course you kin jine us," said Mose Howard, who was
the ringleader in all the devilment in the neighborhood.
"Glad tu have you go 'long. We'll come by for you."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the professor. "I never was coon hunting
in my life, though I've always wanted to go&mdash;just to see
how it is done, you know."</p>

<p>According to promise, Mose Howard, Dick Miller, and
Joe Smiley came by for the professor, who was ready and
waiting, and who joined the hunters, anticipating a jolly old
time.</p>

<p>After winding up the coon hunt, which resulted in the capture
of five possums and three coons, Mose Howard proposed
that they should go back by the fish trap and catch a
mess of fish.</p>

<p>The proposition was unanimously agreed to, and they
struck off down the creek, the professor bringing up the rear,
puffing and blowing, though highly elated at the variation
that this additional act in the programme promised, as well
as at the prospect of a successful raid upon the finny tribe.</p>

<p>The "Dofuny" contraption that Mose dignified with the
name of fish trap consisted merely of a large sack held open
by a hoop, around which the mouth of the sack was fastened,
and a couple of ropes, one end of which was fastened
to each side of the hoop, while the other ends were fastened
to trees on the opposite sides of the stream, in such a way
as to allow the hoop to remain about halfway submerged.</p>

<p>On the bank of the creek was a lantern, in which was
about half a tallow candle.</p>

<p>Producing some matches, Mose lit the candle and proceeded
to explain to the professor the modus operandi of
catching fish with his new-fangled trap.</p>

<p>"You just take the lamp, and wade into the trap, and hold
the lamp right in front of the mouth so that the fish can see
how to run in, and we boys'll go away down the creek and
pull off our clothes and wade into the creek and drive the
fish up and into the trap."</p>

<p>The professor, as unsuspicious of any trick as a sucking
baby, shucked himself, and then taking up the lantern, waded
into the trap that the boys set for him instead of for fish, and
in the construction of which they had not only exhausted
their financial resources in the purchase of the material out
of which it was constructed, but also their ingenuity in the
getting up and fabrication of the same.</p>

<p>"Ugh!" grunted the professor, as he reached the trap and
placed the lantern in the position indicated, "this water is
cold as ice. I want you boys to make haste."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," responded the boys.</p>

<p>"You'll hear us hollerin' as we come," said Mose, and off
they started down the creek in a trot.</p>

<p>"All right," said the professor.</p>

<p>As soon as they got out of sight their gait slackened to a
walk, which they kept till they reached a point some four
hundred yards distant from the trap, when, seating themselves
on a log, they began the most uproarious din of yelling
and howling that had ever awakened the slumbering echoes
of those old woods since the aborigines had vacated the
premises.</p>

<p>After about an hour spent in this way the boys got up and
advanced slowly up the bank of the stream about a hundred
yards, when they seated themselves on another log, where
they continued to whoop and yell like so many wild Indians.</p>

<p>After another hour thus spent they made another advance
which brought the professor and the fish trap within their
range of vision, though, owing to the darkness, they were
not visible to him.</p>

<p>"Hurry up, boys!" he shouted. "I'm nearly froze, and
the candle's nearly out."</p>

<p>That was what they were waiting for&mdash;the candle to burn
out&mdash;so that their failure to catch fish could be laid to the
absence of the light.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!" they shouted back; "we're hurrying as fast
as we can!"</p>

<p>And renewing their yells, they advanced slowly&mdash;very
slowly&mdash;up the stream.</p>

<p>"Hurry up! hurry up!" again shouted the professor. "The
candle will be out in two minutes."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir!" shouted Mose back; "but you must stop
hollerin', or you'll skeer the fish."</p>

<p>Sure enough, in about two minutes the candle gave a last
convulsive flicker, and in the twinkling of an eye thick darkness
reigned as absolutely over the professor and the fish trap
as elsewhere.</p>

<p>"Boys," said Mose, in a tone of voice loud enough for the
professor to hear him, "there ain't no use wadin' in this
water any longer; let's go back an' git our cloze."</p>

<p>Seating themselves on a log, they sat perfectly silent for a
while&mdash;long enough, as they thought, for it to have taken
them to go back to where they commenced their drive, dress
themselves, and reach that point on their return&mdash;when they
got up and resumed their progress upstream.</p>

<p>On reaching the trap, they found the professor on shore,
and though he had completed his toilet, his teeth were chattering
together worse than a pair of castanets rattling off a
quickstep march.</p>

<p>"We'll have to try it over ag'in some other time," said
Mose, "and fetch more candles with us. I thought we had
plenty this time, but we didn't. I guess I'll bring enough
next time."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you fellows hurry up?" said the professor.
"What made you come so slow?" the chattering of his teeth
as he spoke causing him to cut the words into more than the
legitimate number of syllables to which they were entitled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>"Couldn't come no faster," said Mose. "The water was
so thunderin' cold the fish wouldn't drive fast."</p>

<p>Satisfied with this explanation, the professor fell into
ranks as the boys filed off in the direction of home. The
exercise of walking soon brought a reaction in his system,
the first effect of which was to put a stop to the music of the
castanets, and on reaching home he pronounced himself all
right again.</p>

<p>Sometime during the ensuing week Mose Howard informed
the professor that they were going to try the fish trap
again the following Saturday night, and asked him if he
didn't want to go along.</p>

<p>The professor gave an involuntary shudder as the recollection
of that protracted soaking in ice water of the previous
Saturday night flashed across his mind.</p>

<p>Discretion prompted him to give a negative response.
Curiosity, however, got the better of discretion, and he accepted
the invitation.</p>

<p>"I'll be on hand," said he. "There's no fun standing in
that cold water, especially when you get no fish; but if you
can stand it I guess I can."</p>

<p>At the appointed time the boys came by, when, the professor
joining them, they proceeded to the fish trap.</p>

<p>On arriving there, Mose produced a couple of pieces of
candle, one of which he proceeded to light and put in the
lantern. It was nearly twice as long as the one they had
burned out on the previous occasion.</p>

<p>The other piece he placed in the lantern, so that it could
be easily got at if it should be needed.</p>

<p>This latter piece Mose had had manufactured himself
especially for the occasion, and had taken some little pains
in its construction.</p>

<p>After soaking the wick in water until it was perfectly
saturated, he had taken a skillet and melted some tallow
therein; then placing the wick in a mould, he filled the latter
with the melted tallow, and the thing was accomplished.</p>

<p>This particular candle he had carefully marked, so as to
be able to distinguish it from any other candle.</p>

<p>Before completing their arrangements at the fish trap, preparatory
to beginning the drive, the professor proposed that
one of the boys should take his place at the trap while he
accompanied the others and assisted in driving the fish.</p>

<p>"Kin you swim?" asked Mose Howard.</p>

<p>"No," answered the professor.</p>

<p>"Well, you'd run the resk ov gittin' drownded, then," said
Mose.</p>

<p>"You go on, then," said the professor, "and I'll mind the
trap."</p>

<p>So off the boys started, and going down the stream about a
mile, seated themselves upon a log, and began yelling and
whooping, as on the previous occasion.</p>

<p>Hour after hour passed, each hour seeming to the benumbed
professor an age.</p>

<p>The yelling approached slowly but surely.</p>

<p>The boys had now arrived at a point where every motion
of the professor was distinctly visible.</p>

<p>The piece of candle Mose had lighted and put in the lantern
was nearly burned out. Taking up the other piece, the
professor proceeded to light it. Placing it in the lantern, it
gave a splutter and went out. Dark! Dark was no name for
it. No moon, no stars, no matches.</p>

<p>But that bogus candle would have been a match for a
whole box of matches.</p>

<p>"What in thunder's the matter now?" shouted Mose.</p>

<p>"The candle's gone out," shouted the professor back.
"Have you got any matches?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Nary match," said Mose.</p>

<p>"What's to be done?" inquired the professor.</p>

<p>"Nuthin'," said Mose. "The thing's played out. Put on
your cloze, while we go and git ourn, and then we'll git for
home."</p>

<p>Seating themselves on a log, the boys remained quiet for
a while, then rising to their feet, they came up to where the
professor was waltzing around trying to get up a circulation.</p>

<p>"Another waterhaul," said Mose.</p>

<p>"Looks a good deal like it," said the professor.</p>

<p>"Don't know why the mischief some of us didn't think tu
bring some matches," said Mose.</p>

<p>"I don't know, either," responded the professor, in a deprecating
tone of voice, as though he entertained the idea that
somehow or other he had been mainly instrumental in producing
the bad luck.</p>

<p>"Better luck next time," said Mose philosophically, as he
struck out for home, followed by the others.</p>

<p>They had proceeded about two-thirds of the way home,
groping their way as best they could through the thick darkness,
when a shrill, prolonged scream directly ahead of them,
and apparently at no great distance, broke upon their startled
auriculars.</p>

<p>"Painter!" ejaculated Mose, in a low tone of voice, though
sufficiently loud to be distinctly audible to the professor, at
the same time springing to one side, and the next moment he
was out of the professor's hearing.</p>

<p>The fact was he had only taken a couple of steps and then
squatted in the grass as completely concealed from his companions
by the intense darkness as though he had been on
the opposite side of the globe.</p>

<p>"Painter!" repeated the other boys, following Mose's example,
of springing to one side and squatting in the grass.</p>

<p>Left alone, the professor, with hair on end, paused a moment
to collect his scattered thoughts; but only for a moment.</p>

<p>Another scream long drawn out, and apparently but a few
yards distant, set his dumpling-shaped body in motion, and
the next moment he was streaking it across the country as
fast as his duck legs could carry him.</p>

<p>Tumbling over a log lying on the edge of a bank some
twenty feet high and nearly perpendicular, down which he
rolled, he landed in a mud hole at the bottom.</p>

<p>Gathering himself up he began looking for his hat, which
had parted company with him on the way down the bank,
when, another scream breaking upon his ear, he struck out
once more on his race for life, hatless and covered with mud
from his head to his heels.</p>

<p>Coming to a brier patch, he was on the point of diverging
from his course in order to try and go around it, when another
scream precipitated the terror-stricken professor into
the patch like a catapult.</p>

<p>Emerging from the brier patch with his coat tails torn
into ribbons, the mud-begrimed professor held on the even
tenor of his way without any diminution of speed for a hundred
yards or so, when his pace began to slacken a little.
Another scream, however, put him to his mettle again, but
as that was the last, and as he was about exhausted, he soon
settled down to a walk, and presently stumbling over a log,
he picked himself up and seated himself thereon.</p>

<p>After resting a while, plunged in the meantime in a deep
cogitation, he finally concluded to try and seek a shelter for
the remainder of the night. So, starting forward, he wandered
about first in one direction and then in another, and it
was not until daylight began to streak the eastern horizon
that he stumbled on a clearing in the woods, in the midst of
which was a log cabin.</p>

<p>Cautiously approaching the cabin, he had reached the foot
of a sapling some fifty steps from the door when a big dog
came dashing around the corner of the house, barking in a
most furious manner.</p>

<p>No sooner did the professor catch sight of the dog bouncing
along in the direction of him and the sapling than he was
seized with such a sudden panic as to cause him to grasp the
sapling in his arms and start up it, though, owing to want of
practice, with hardly the agility of a squirrel. After a tremendous
effort he succeeded in reaching a fork some ten feet
from the ground, where he seated himself, and awaited the
issue of events.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>He didn't have long to wait. The furious barking of the
dog soon roused the inmates of the cabin.</p>

<p>Scarcely a minute had elapsed after the professor had
succeeded, by the most superhuman exertions, in seating himself
comfortably in the fork of the sapling, out of the reach
of the dog, when the door of the cabin opened and a huge
six-footer of a backwoodsman, somewhat airily attired, with
a rifle of corresponding size with himself in his hand,
emerged therefrom.</p>

<p>"What you got thar, Bull?" said the man, as he approached
the sapling, at the root of which the dog was barking in a
most vociferous manner. "What is it, old feller?" he continued.
"B'ar, painter, ur catamount?"</p>

<p>Bull's response was an abortive attempt to climb the tree,
accompanied by a most furious outburst of barking.</p>

<p>"Be quiet, old feller," said the man; "we'll soon see what
it is," at the same time raising his rifle to his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Hold on there," shouted the professor, who was beginning
to realize the perilous position in which he was placed,
and the imminent danger he was in of being shot for a bear
or catamount. "I am no varmint. I'm Nicodemus Squab,
Professor of Orthography in the Jimtown district school."</p>

<p>"Hallo," said the backwoodsman, as he lowered his rifle,
"is that so? Well, that gits me. What in thunder ur you
doin' up thar?"</p>

<p>"Wait till I get down, and I'll tell you."</p>

<p>And crawling out of the crotch in which he had been
seated, the professor slid down the sapling, when he soon
succeeded in explaining matters to the satisfaction of that
thinly clad backwoodsman and his savage bulldog.</p>

<p>It was now broad daylight, and when he reached Jimtown
the sun was some distance above the horizon, climbing upward
toward the zenith.</p>

<p>Of course every man, woman, and child in the place beheld,
with wonder-depicted countenances, the advent of the
mud-begrimed, hatless professor, and a thousand conjectures
were indulged in as to the cause of his singular appearance.</p>

<p>The professor was disposed to be reticent on the subject,
answering interrogatories in relation to the matter evasively;
but the joke was too good to be kept, and in less than
twenty-four hours his approach toward any crowd was
greeted by a broad grin overspreading the countenances of a
majority of the members thereof, and his departure signalized
by a long guffaw.</p>

<p>This conduct on the part of the citizens annoyed the professor
considerably at first; then it grew monotonous, and he
became disgusted.</p>

<p>Finally he burst into a flame of indignation, and after taking
his revenge out of the hides of the pupils, especially Mose
Howard and his confederates, the irate professor shook the
dust of Jimtown off his feet, and betook himself to parts
unknown.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="PHOTOGRAPHS_TAKEN_IN_DANGEROUS_PLACES" id="PHOTOGRAPHS_TAKEN_IN_DANGEROUS_PLACES">PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN IN DANGEROUS PLACES.</a></h2>


<p>"Race war in Alabama. Take cinematograph pictures of
fighting and country." "Want pictures of Dyaks of Borneo
as soon as possible." "Series wanted of whale-hunting in
Arctic regions."</p>

<p>The average man, receiving one of these messages with
his breakfast, would not regard the commission exactly in
the light of a pleasure trip. To the cinematograph man,
however, such orders are all in a day's work. He simply packs
up his machine, makes his arrangements in the shortest possible
time, and goes right ahead with the business.</p>

<p>It is thrilling and wonderful work at times; and it requires
a little patience, too. "One of our photographers," said the
manager of a company recently, "once sat beside a geyser
in Iceland for three weeks, waiting for an eruption to take
place, in order that he might obtain some pictures of this
wonderful phenomenon. The geyser seemed in no hurry to
oblige him, so he left the district for a couple of days. When
he returned he found that the eruption had taken place and
the geyser had again become inactive.</p>

<p>"Another of our photographers, who went out to Borneo
to take pictures of the home life of the natives, narrowly
escaped losing his head as well as his machine. The natives
thought the latter was some new and powerful weapon, and
it was only by the timely intervention of the interpreter, who
explained matters, that they adopted a more friendly attitude.</p>

<p>"By the way, this particular photographer raised a good
laugh when he came home. We wanted some pictures taken
while traveling down the water chute at an exhibition. It
was necessary for the operator and the machine to be
strapped to the boat, in order that he might be quite free to
turn the handle and take the photographs as he shot down
the chute. I asked the photographer from Borneo to do the
job. 'I would rather be excused,' he said; 'I've got a weak
heart.' Here was a man, who spent weeks among one of the
most savage tribes in the world, who was afraid to go down
a water chute. Nerves are peculiar things.</p>

<p>"I think, however, the worst experience which has befallen
one of our photographers was that of the man we sent to
take the pictures of a whale-hunting expedition. A fine
school&mdash;I believe that is the correct term&mdash;of whales was
sighted one day. The boats went in pursuit, and our photographer
with his machine entered one of them. The crew
of this boat managed to harpoon a fine big whale, who went
through the sea at a terrific pace, dragging the boat behind
him. Our photographer was just congratulating himself on
getting some of the most realistic pictures ever obtained,
when suddenly the whale doubled in its tracks, and, to make
a long story short, smashed the boat. Luckily, another boat
came up at the critical moment and rescued the crew and
the photographer. But the latter is always bemoaning the
fact that one of the finest sets of cinematograph pictures ever
taken lies at the bottom of the Arctic Ocean."</p>

<p>Some of the most interesting pictures shown, however,
are scenes taken en route while traveling by rail in various
parts of the world. A special engine is chartered, and the
operator, with his machine, takes his place on the front platform
of the engine, or on a low truck which the engine
pushes in front of it. Thus mile after mile of scenery is
photographed as the engine rushes along. It is a rather
ticklish job, particularly in wild regions where all sorts of
animals stray on to the line, and there is a risk of collision
and general smash.</p>

<p>Doubtless many readers are acquainted with the entertaining
and novel manner in which these pictures are afterward
shown. One sits in a stationary model of a railway carriage,
the picture being thrown on a screen at the end. A
motor underneath the carriage gives a realistic impression
of the noise made by a train when traveling, and thus one
seems to be rushing through the country which is being depicted
on the screen. It is a novel notion, which is deserving
of all the success and popularity it has attained.</p>

<h2><a name="COSTLY_FISHES" id="COSTLY_FISHES">COSTLY FISHES.</a></h2>


<p>The most beautiful and withal costly fishes in the world
come from China, and of these the most expensive and rarest
is the brush-tail goldfish. Specimens of these have sold for
as high as $700 each, and in Europe the prices range from
$250 to $500. The brush-tail goldfish is so small that a
half-crown piece will cover it, and probably there is no living
thing of its size and weight that is worth so much money.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
